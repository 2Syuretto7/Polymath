  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        In 1883 the French mathematician Édouard Lucas sold a puzzle with a legend attached. In a temple at Benares, priests
        move a tower of 64 golden discs from one diamond needle to another, one disc at a time, never placing a larger disc
        on a smaller. When they finish, the world will end.
      </p>
      <p>How many moves do they need, at the least? And how could you be sure of the answer for 64 discs, without trying?</p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Try small towers. One disc takes 1 move; two take 3; three take 7. To move a tower of <M>n</M>, you must at some
        point move the largest disc, and before that the other <M>{"n - 1"}</M> must all be out of the way on the third peg.
        So: move <M>{"n - 1"}</M>, move the largest, move <M>{"n - 1"}</M> back on top. If <M>{"n - 1"}</M> discs need{" "}
        <M>{"2^{n-1} - 1"}</M> moves, then <M>n</M> discs need <M>{"2(2^{n-1} - 1) + 1 = 2^n - 1"}</M>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That argument is a chain: the answer for one disc gives it for two, two gives three, and so on for ever, like a row
        of dominoes each knocking over the next. This is <strong>induction</strong>. For 64 discs it gives{" "}
        <M>{"2^{64} - 1"}</M> moves, which at one a second is about 585 billion years. The world is safe for now.

      <Theorem title="the principle of induction">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"P(n)"}</M> be a statement about the whole number <M>n</M>. Suppose that
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>base case:</strong> <M>{"P(1)"}</M> is true, and</li>
          <li><strong>inductive step:</strong> for every <M>{"k \\ge 1"}</M>, if <M>{"P(k)"}</M> is true then <M>{"P(k+1)"}</M> is true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then <M>{"P(n)"}</M> is true for every whole number <M>{"n \\ge 1"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        Why believe it? If some <M>{"P(n)"}</M> failed, there would be a smallest <M>n</M> for which it fails. It is not 1, by
        the base case. So <M>{"P(n-1)"}</M> holds, and the inductive step then gives <M>{"P(n)"}</M>, a contradiction. This
        rests on a basic property of the natural numbers from the very first lesson: every non-empty set of them has a
        smallest member. The base case can start at any number, not just 1.
      </p>

      <Example title="the sum of squares">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"P(n)"}</M> say <M>{"\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\tfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}"}</M>. The base case: both sides are 1
          when <M>{"n = 1"}</M>. The inductive step: assume <M>{"P(k)"}</M>. Then
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\sum_{j=1}^{k+1} j^2 = \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} + (k+1)^2 = \\frac{(k+1)\\big(k(2k+1) + 6(k+1)\\big)}{6} = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)}{6},"}</MD>
        <p>
          since <M>{"2k^2 + 7k + 6 = (k+2)(2k+3)"}</M>. That is exactly <M>{"P(k+1)"}</M>. By induction, the formula holds
          for every <M>n</M>.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Theorem title="the tower puzzle">
        <p>A tower of <M>n</M> discs can be moved in <M>{"2^n - 1"}</M> moves, and no fewer.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Induction on <M>n</M>. One disc takes one move. Suppose <M>k</M> discs need exactly <M>{"2^k - 1"}</M> moves at best.
          With <M>{"k + 1"}</M> discs, the largest must move at least once, and at its first move the other <M>k</M> must all
          be on the third peg, which takes at least <M>{"2^k - 1"}</M> moves. After its last move they must all come back on
          top of it, at least <M>{"2^k - 1"}</M> more. So at least <M>{"2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1"}</M>, and the strategy
          in the picture achieves it.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Definition title="strong induction">
        <p>
          Sometimes the step from <M>k</M> to <M>{"k + 1"}</M> needs not just <M>{"P(k)"}</M> but some earlier case. It is
          equally valid to assume <M>{"P(1), \\ldots, P(k)"}</M> all at once and deduce <M>{"P(k+1)"}</M>. The same smallest
          counterexample argument justifies it.

      <Remark title="all horses are the same colour">
        <p>
          Here is a famous false proof. Claim: in any group of <M>n</M> horses, all are the same colour. Base case: one horse
          is one colour. Step: given <M>{"k + 1"}</M> horses, the first <M>k</M> are all one colour by assumption, and so are
          the last <M>k</M>; the two groups overlap, so all <M>{"k + 1"}</M> match. Where is the mistake? Try{" "}
          <M>{"k = 1"}</M>: the first horse and the last horse do not overlap. The step must work for <em>every</em>{" "}
          <M>k</M>, and here one link of the chain is missing. Finding exactly which step fails, as in the philosopher&rsquo;s
          toolkit, is the skill.

      Next, counting, where induction often supplies the proofs. Induction returns properly in Proof and Logic, with strong
      induction, the well-ordering principle and recursive definitions. In computing, the tower puzzle is the classic example
      of recursion, where a problem is solved by solving smaller copies of itself.
