  puzzle: (

      <p>
        Four cards lie on a table. Each has a letter on one side and a number on the other. You see <strong>E</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>K</strong>, <strong>4</strong> and <strong>7</strong>. Someone claims: &ldquo;If a card has a vowel on one
        side, then it has an even number on the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Which cards must you turn over to check whether the claim is true? Decide before reading on. This is among the most
        studied puzzles in psychology, and most clever adults get it wrong.
      </p>
    </>

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The rule &ldquo;vowel <M>{"\\to"}</M> even&rdquo; can only be broken by a card with a vowel and an odd number. So turn
        the vowel, E, in case there is an odd number behind it, and turn the odd number, 7, in case there is a vowel behind
        it. The 4 tempts nearly everyone, but a consonant behind it would break nothing: the rule never said even numbers have
        vowels. Turning the 4 tests the <strong>converse</strong>, a different statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Checking the 7 is the <strong>contrapositive</strong> at work: &ldquo;if odd, then not a vowel&rdquo; says the same as
        the rule. Try both versions below; the second has exactly the same logic.

      <Definition title="converse, inverse and contrapositive">
        <p>For the conditional <M>{"P \\to Q"}</M>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>its <strong>converse</strong> is <M>{"Q \\to P"}</M>;</li>
          <li>its <strong>inverse</strong> is <M>{"\\neg P \\to \\neg Q"}</M>;</li>
          <li>its <strong>contrapositive</strong> is <M>{"\\neg Q \\to \\neg P"}</M>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In <M>{"P \\to Q"}</M>, P is the <strong>hypothesis</strong> or antecedent and Q the <strong>conclusion</strong> or consequent.</p>
      </Definition>

      <Proposition title="the contrapositive is equivalent">
        <p>
          <M>{"P \\to Q \\equiv \\neg Q \\to \\neg P"}</M>. The converse and the inverse are equivalent to each other, but
          not to the original.
        </p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"\\neg Q \\to \\neg P \\equiv \\neg\\neg Q \\vee \\neg P \\equiv Q \\vee \\neg P \\equiv \\neg P \\vee Q \\equiv P \\to Q"}</M>.
          The inverse is the contrapositive of the converse, so those two are equivalent. And the row with P false and Q true
          makes <M>{"P \\to Q"}</M> true but <M>{"Q \\to P"}</M> false.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Definition title="necessary and sufficient">
        <p>
          In <M>{"P \\to Q"}</M>, P is a <strong>sufficient condition</strong> for Q, and Q is a{" "}
          <strong>necessary condition</strong> for P. All of these say the same:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\text{if } P \\text{ then } Q; \\quad P \\text{ only if } Q; \\quad Q \\text{ if } P; \\quad Q \\text{ whenever } P; \\quad P \\text{ is sufficient for } Q; \\quad Q \\text{ is necessary for } P."}</MD>
        <p>
          &ldquo;P if and only if Q&rdquo;, often written &ldquo;P iff Q&rdquo;, says each is necessary and sufficient for
          the other.

      </Definition>

      <Example title="converses in mathematics">
        <p>
          &ldquo;If a number is divisible by 4, it is even&rdquo; is true; its converse, &ldquo;if a number is even, it is
          divisible by 4&rdquo;, is false (try 6). Pythagoras says: if a triangle has a right angle at C, then{" "}
          <M>{"a^2 + b^2 = c^2"}</M>. Its converse happens to be true as well, but that needs its own proof (by the law of
          cosines, for instance). A true converse is a separate theorem, never a free gift.

      <Remark title="two classic mistakes">
        <p>
          <strong>Affirming the consequent:</strong> &ldquo;if P then Q; Q; so P&rdquo;. If it rained, the road is wet; the
          road is wet; so it rained? Perhaps a tanker spilled water. <strong>Denying the antecedent:</strong> &ldquo;if P then
          Q; not P; so not Q&rdquo;. Both confuse a conditional with its converse. Their valid cousins are{" "}
          <em>modus ponens</em> (P → Q, P; so Q) and <em>modus tollens</em> (P → Q, not Q; so not P), the second of which is
          the contrapositive in action, and the logic behind the 7 card.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      This completes propositional logic. Next come quantifiers, &ldquo;for all&rdquo; and &ldquo;there exists&rdquo;, which
      most mathematical statements need. In the chapter on proof, the contrapositive becomes a proof technique of its own:
      to prove &ldquo;if P then Q&rdquo;, assume Q fails and show P fails. Critical Reasoning collects the everyday fallacies
      that come from confusing a conditional with its converse.
