  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        A colony of bacteria triples every hour. At noon there are 1000. How many are there at half past twelve? At a
        quarter past?
      </p>
      <p>
        And here is the deeper question. You know what <M>{"3^2"}</M> and <M>{"3^{1/2}"}</M> mean. What could{" "}
        <M>{"3^{\\pi}"}</M> possibly mean, when <M>{"\\pi"}</M> is not a fraction at all?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        If the colony triples every hour, it multiplies by the same factor <M>c</M> in each half hour, and two half hours
        make an hour, so <M>{"c^2 = 3"}</M> and <M>{"c = \\sqrt3 = 3^{1/2}"}</M>. At half past twelve there are about{" "}
        <M>{"1000 \\times 1.732 = 1732"}</M>. The same reasoning gives <M>{"3^{1/4} \\approx 1.316"}</M> per quarter hour,
        so about 1316 at a quarter past. Fractional powers are exactly what continuous growth needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <M>{"3^\\pi"}</M>, approximate. Since <M>{"3.14 < \\pi < 3.15"}</M>, and larger exponents give larger powers of
        3, the number <M>{"3^\\pi"}</M> must lie between <M>{"3^{3.14}"}</M> and <M>{"3^{3.15}"}</M>, both of which are
        powers with fractional exponents. Narrowing the interval narrows the answer, and the nested intervals close on a
        single real number. Explore the graphs that result.

  ),

  theory: (
    <>
      <p>
        Fix a base <M>{"b > 0"}</M>. From the lesson on exponents, <M>{"b^{m/n} = \\sqrt[n]{b^m}"}</M> is defined for
        every fraction <M>{"\\tfrac{m}{n}"}</M>, and the laws of exponents hold. Suppose <M>{"b > 1"}</M>. Then bigger
        fractional exponents give bigger powers, and this is what lets us fill the gaps.
      </p>

      <Definition title="real exponents">
        <p>
          For <M>{"b > 1"}</M> and a real number <M>x</M>, <M>{"b^x"}</M> is the unique real number that lies between{" "}
          <M>{"b^p"}</M> and <M>{"b^q"}</M> for every pair of fractions <M>{"p \\le x \\le q"}</M>. For{" "}
          <M>{"0 < b < 1"}</M>, define <M>{"b^x = (1/b)^{-x}"}</M>, and set <M>{"1^x = 1"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>
      <p>
        That exactly one such number exists comes from the completeness of the real line: the intervals{" "}
        <M>{"[b^p, b^q]"}</M> are nested and their widths shrink to zero as <M>p</M> and <M>q</M> close in on <M>x</M>. We
        take this on trust here; Analysis proves it, and Calculus gives a slicker definition through the exponential series.
      </p>

      <Definition title="exponential function">
        <p>
          For a fixed base <M>{"b > 0"}</M> with <M>{"b \\neq 1"}</M>, the <strong>exponential function</strong> with base{" "}
          <M>b</M> is <M>{"x \\mapsto b^x"}</M>, from all real numbers to the positive reals.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="properties">
        <p>For <M>{"b > 0"}</M>, <M>{"b \\neq 1"}</M>, and all real <M>x</M> and <M>y</M>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><M>{"b^{x+y} = b^x b^y"}</M>, <M>{"(b^x)^y = b^{xy}"}</M> and <M>{"b^{-x} = \\tfrac{1}{b^x}"}</M>;</li>
          <li><M>{"b^x > 0"}</M> and <M>{"b^0 = 1"}</M>;</li>
          <li>if <M>{"b > 1"}</M>, then <M>{"x < y"}</M> implies <M>{"b^x < b^y"}</M>; if <M>{"0 < b < 1"}</M>, the inequality reverses;</li>
          <li>so <M>{"x \\mapsto b^x"}</M> is one-to-one, and its range is all the positive reals.</li>
        </ol>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        The laws pass from fractional exponents to real ones by approximation; we accept them here. The third property, for
        whole-number exponents, you can prove now.
      </p>

      <Proposition title="bigger exponent, bigger power">
        <p>If <M>{"b > 1"}</M> and <M>{"m < n"}</M> are whole numbers, then <M>{"b^m < b^n"}</M>.</p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"b^n = b^m \\cdot b^{n-m}"}</M>, and <M>{"b^{n-m}"}</M> is a product of <M>{"n - m \\ge 1"}</M> factors each
          greater than 1, so it is greater than 1. Multiplying the positive number <M>{"b^m"}</M> by something greater than 1
          makes it larger.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="the shape of the graph">
        <p>
          Every graph <M>{"y = b^x"}</M> passes through <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M> and <M>{"(1, b)"}</M>. For <M>{"b > 1"}</M> it
          rises ever more steeply to the right and hugs the <M>x</M>-axis to the left, getting as close as you like without
          touching: the <M>x</M>-axis is a <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong>. Since{" "}
          <M>{"(1/b)^x = b^{-x}"}</M>, the graph for base <M>{"1/b"}</M> is the reflection in the <M>y</M>-axis, a
          transformation from the last chapter.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="fitting an exponential model">
        <p>
          A model <M>{"N(t) = A b^t"}</M> is fixed by two observations. Suppose <M>{"N(0) = 500"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"N(2) = 4500"}</M>. Then <M>{"A = 500"}</M> and <M>{"500 b^2 = 4500"}</M>, so <M>{"b^2 = 9"}</M> and, since{" "}
          <M>{"b > 0"}</M>, <M>{"b = 3"}</M>. The model predicts <M>{"N(3.5) = 500 \\cdot 3^{3.5} \\approx 23{,}383"}</M>.

        <MD>{"\\frac{N(t + 1)}{N(t)} = \\frac{A b^{t+1}}{A b^t} = b"}</MD>
        <p>for every real <M>t</M>, not only whole numbers: the growth factor over any interval of length 1 is the same.</p>

      Next, logarithms: the inverse of the exponential function, which answers &ldquo;what power gives this number?&rdquo;.
      In Calculus, limits make the definition of <M>{"b^x"}</M> rigorous, and the exponential function is rebuilt from its
      power series. Analysis proves the nested-interval argument used here from the completeness of the reals.
