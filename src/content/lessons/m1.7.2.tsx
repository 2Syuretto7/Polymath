      <p>
        A cinema hall has 200 seats, and a crowd is filing in. Nobody is counting. When everyone is seated, every seat is
        taken and nobody is standing or sharing. How many people came?
      </p>
      <p>
        You know without counting: 200. The seating pairs people with seats perfectly. What precisely is this perfect
        pairing, and what can each half of it tell you on its own?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nobody shares a seat&rdquo; says that different people go to different seats. &ldquo;Every seat is
        taken&rdquo; says that each seat receives someone. The first alone tells you there are no more people than seats; the
        second alone, no more seats than people. Together they give equality.

      <Example title="the same rule, four answers">
        <p>
          Whether a function is injective or surjective depends on its domain and codomain, not just its rule. Consider{" "}
          <M>{"x \\mapsto x^2"}</M>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>from <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> to <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>: neither, since <M>{"(-1)^2 = 1^2"}</M> and nothing maps to <M>{"-1"}</M>;</li>
          <li>from <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M> to <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>: injective, not surjective;</li>
          <li>from <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> to <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M>: surjective, not injective;</li>

      <Theorem title="proving injectivity">
        <p>The function <M>{"f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}"}</M>, <M>{"f(x) = 3x + 7"}</M>, is a bijection.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <em>Injective.</em> Suppose <M>{"f(a_1) = f(a_2)"}</M>. Then <M>{"3a_1 + 7 = 3a_2 + 7"}</M>, so{" "}

        <p>
          <em>Surjective.</em> Let <M>{"b \\in \\mathbb{R}"}</M>. We need a with <M>{"3a + 7 = b"}</M>; solving gives{" "}
          <M>{"a = (b - 7)/3"}</M>, which is a real number, and indeed <M>{"f(a) = b"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        This is the standard pattern. For injectivity, assume two outputs are equal and deduce that the inputs are: this proves the contrapositive of
        &ldquo;different inputs give different outputs&rdquo;, which is usually easier. For
        surjectivity, take an arbitrary output and construct an input that reaches it, then check.

      <Remark title="the pigeonhole principle">
        <p>
          The first statement, turned around, is the <strong>pigeonhole principle</strong>: if more than n pigeons fly into n
          holes, some hole holds two pigeons. For example, among any 13 people, two were born in the same month. This simple
          fact has surprisingly deep uses.

      A bijection can be run backwards. The next lesson combines functions by doing one after another, and undoes them with
      inverses. Counting injections and bijections is central to Discrete Mathematics, the pigeonhole principle has its own
      lesson there, and the bijections of a set to itself form the symmetric group of Abstract Algebra.
