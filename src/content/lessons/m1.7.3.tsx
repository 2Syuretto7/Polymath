  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        In the morning you put on socks, then shoes. In the evening, to undo this, you take off the shoes first, then the
        socks. Undoing reverses the order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now an arithmetic version: a machine doubles a number and then adds 3. What machine undoes it? And when can a
        function be undone at all? Squaring sends both 3 and <M>{"-3"}</M> to 9; given only the 9, can you say where it came
        from?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Doing one function and then another gives a new function, their <strong>composite</strong>. Undoing a function means
        following its arrows backwards. That works only if every output came from exactly one input: no output is missed, and
        no output is shared. In other words, only a bijection can be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, f goes from A to B and g from B to C. The lower diagram shows the composite, found by following an arrow of f and
        then one of g. Click elements to change f and g, then try to reverse f.

          Given <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M> and <M>{"g : B \\to C"}</M>, the <strong>composite</strong>{" "}
          <M>{"g \\circ f : A \\to C"}</M> is defined by

          It is read &ldquo;g after f&rdquo;: f acts first, although it is written on the right. Composition is{" "}
          <strong>associative</strong>, <M>{"h \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f"}</M>, since both send a to{" "}
          <M>{"h(g(f(a)))"}</M>. It is usually not commutative: with <M>{"f(x) = x + 1"}</M> and <M>{"g(x) = x^2"}</M>,{" "}

      <Definition title="identity and inverse">
        <p>
          The <strong>identity</strong> on A is <M>{"\\mathrm{id}_A : A \\to A"}</M>, <M>{"\\mathrm{id}_A(a) = a"}</M>. A function{" "}
          <M>{"g : B \\to A"}</M> is an <strong>inverse</strong> of <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M> if

      <Theorem title="invertible means bijective">
        <p>A function <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M> has an inverse if and only if it is a bijection.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose f has an inverse g. If <M>{"f(a_1) = f(a_2)"}</M>, apply g to get <M>{"a_1 = a_2"}</M>, so f is injective.
          Any <M>{"b \\in B"}</M> equals <M>{"f(g(b))"}</M>, so f is surjective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose f is a bijection. For each <M>{"b \\in B"}</M> there is an a with <M>{"f(a) = b"}</M>, by
          surjectivity, and only one, by injectivity. Define <M>{"g(b)"}</M> to be that a. Then <M>{"f(g(b)) = b"}</M> by
          construction, and <M>{"g(f(a)) = a"}</M> because a is the unique element sent to <M>{"f(a)"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="undoing a machine">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"f(x) = 2x + 3"}</M> on <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>. Solving <M>{"y = 2x + 3"}</M> for x gives{" "}
          <M>{"f^{-1}(y) = (y - 3)/2"}</M>: subtract 3, then halve. The inverse undoes the steps in reverse order, like the
          shoes and socks. In general, if f and g are bijections,

        <MD>{"(g \\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}."}</MD>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="partial undoing">
        <p>
          An injective function can be undone on its image, and a surjective one can be undone on one side: if f is surjective,
          choosing one preimage for each output gives g with <M>{"f \\circ g = \\mathrm{id}_B"}</M>. For infinite sets, making
          all those choices at once is exactly what the axiom of choice permits. This is why the square root function picks the
          non-negative root: it is an inverse of squaring restricted to <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M>.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The last lesson on functions asks what a function does to whole sets of inputs, and which inputs land in a given set of
      outputs. Inverse matrices in Linear Algebra and inverse functions in Calculus are this lesson put to work, and bijections
      of a set to itself, under composition, form a group.
