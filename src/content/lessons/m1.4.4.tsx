        Each one sits inside the one before, and each one contains infinitely many numbers. What numbers lie in <em>all</em>{" "}
        of them at once? Is there at least one? Decide before reading on.

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Take any candidate x. It must be greater than 0, since every interval is open at 0. But then, however small x is, some{" "}
        <M>{"\\tfrac1n"}</M> is smaller still, and x is left out of <M>{"(0, \\tfrac1n)"}</M>. So no number lies in all of them:
        the intersection of infinitely many nested, non-empty intervals is empty.

        Change one detail, closing the intervals, and the answer changes. Explore several families below, watching what the
        union and intersection do as more sets are added.

      <Definition title="indexed family">
        <p>
          An <strong>indexed family</strong> of sets is a collection <M>{"\\{A_i : i \\in I\\}"}</M> with one set{" "}
          <M>{"A_i"}</M> for each index i in an <strong>index set</strong> I. Often <M>{"I = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}"}</M>, giving a
          sequence of sets <M>{"A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Definition title="union and intersection of a family">
        <MD>{"\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i = \\{\\, x : \\exists i \\in I,\\ x \\in A_i \\,\\}, \\qquad \\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i = \\{\\, x : \\forall i \\in I,\\ x \\in A_i \\,\\}."}</MD>
        <p>
          The union collects everything in at least one of the sets; the intersection keeps only what is in every one. The
          quantifiers do all the work.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="the puzzle">
        <p><M>{"\\displaystyle\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(0, \\tfrac1n\\right) = \\varnothing"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose, for contradiction, that x lies in every interval. Then <M>{"x \\in (0, 1)"}</M>, so <M>{"x > 0"}</M>. Choose
          a whole number n with <M>{"n > 1/x"}</M>; then <M>{"\\tfrac1n < x"}</M>, so <M>{"x \\notin (0, \\tfrac1n)"}</M>, a
          contradiction.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="closed intervals behave differently">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\bigcap_{n} [-\\tfrac1n, \\tfrac1n] = \\{0\\}"}</M>: 0 is in every one, and any <M>{"x \\ne 0"}</M> is excluded
          once <M>{"\\tfrac1n < |x|"}</M>. And <M>{"\\bigcup_n [\\tfrac1n, 2] = (0, 2]"}</M>: a union of closed intervals need
          not be closed. Infinite operations can produce sets unlike any of the sets you started with.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Theorem title="De Morgan's laws for families">
        <MD>{"\\Big(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i\\Big)^c = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i^c, \\qquad \\Big(\\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i\\Big)^c = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i^c."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"x \\notin \\bigcup A_i"}</M> means <M>{"\\neg \\exists i\\, (x \\in A_i)"}</M>, which by the quantifier laws is{" "}
          <M>{"\\forall i\\, (x \\notin A_i)"}</M>, that is, <M>{"x \\in \\bigcap A_i^c"}</M>. The second law is the same with
          the quantifiers swapped.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why the order of limits matters">
        <p>
          The puzzle shows something unsettling: a property that holds at every finite stage (the intersection of the first N
          intervals is non-empty) can fail &ldquo;at infinity&rdquo;. Zeno of Elea built paradoxes on such surprises. Much of
          Real Analysis is about knowing when finite truths survive the passage to the infinite. The completeness of the real
          numbers guarantees, for instance, that nested <em>closed</em> bounded intervals always share a point.

      The last lesson on sets builds two new kinds of set from old: the set of all subsets, and the set of all ordered pairs.
      Unions and intersections of families are the language of open and closed sets in Real Analysis and metric spaces, and
      of sigma-algebras in Measure Theory.
