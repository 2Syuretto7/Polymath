  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        You walk 5 km east, then 3 km west. You have walked 8 km, yet you are only 2 km from where you started. Could you ever
        end up further from home than the total distance you walked?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the kind of question that fills the rest of this course. If x is within 1 of 2, how far can <M>{"x^2"}</M> be
        from 4? Can you make <M>{"x^2"}</M> as close to 4 as you like, just by making x close enough to 2?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The absolute value <M>{"|x|"}</M> is the distance from x to 0, and <M>{"|x - a|"}</M> is the distance from x to a.
        Analysis is the art of making things close, so it uses this one tool constantly. An inequality such as{" "}
        <M>{"|x - a| < r"}</M> is a compact way of saying &ldquo;x is within r of a&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualisation has two parts. The first shows <M>{"|x - a| < r"}</M> as an interval. The second shows the most
        useful inequality in analysis, the triangle inequality, as two walks along a line.

      <Theorem title="the triangle inequality">

          For all real x and y, <M>{"|x + y| \\le |x| + |y|"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>By property 3, <M>{"-|x| \\le x \\le |x|"}</M> and <M>{"-|y| \\le y \\le |y|"}</M>. Adding,</p>
        <MD>{"-(|x| + |y|) \\le x + y \\le |x| + |y|,"}</MD>
        <p>
          which by property 4 (in its form with <M>{"\\le"}</M>) says exactly that <M>{"|x + y| \\le |x| + |y|"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why it is called the triangle inequality">
        <p>
          Put <M>{"x = a - b"}</M> and <M>{"y = b - c"}</M>. Then it says <M>{"|a - c| \\le |a - b| + |b - c|"}</M>: going from
          a to c directly is never longer than going by way of b. In the plane, this is the fact that one side of a triangle is
          never longer than the other two together.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="solving an inequality">
        <p>
          Solve <M>{"|2x - 1| < 5"}</M>. By property 4, this means <M>{"-5 < 2x - 1 < 5"}</M>, so <M>{"-4 < 2x < 6"}</M>, so{" "}
          <M>{"-2 < x < 3"}</M>. And <M>{"|x + 3| \\ge 2"}</M> means x is at least 2 away from <M>{"-3"}</M>: either{" "}
          <M>{"x \\le -5"}</M> or <M>{"x \\ge -1"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="an estimate, of the kind analysis is made of">
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"|x - 2| < 1"}</M>. How far is <M>{"x^2"}</M> from 4? Factorise:{" "}
          <M>{"|x^2 - 4| = |x - 2|\\,|x + 2|"}</M>. Since <M>{"1 < x < 3"}</M>, we have <M>{"3 < x + 2 < 5"}</M>, so{" "}
          <M>{"|x + 2| < 5"}</M>, and
        </p>
        <MD>{"|x^2 - 4| < 5\\,|x - 2|."}</MD>
        <p>
          So to make <M>{"x^2"}</M> within 0.01 of 4, it is enough to make x within 0.002 of 2. The method, bounding one
          factor crudely and keeping the other small, is the heart of the next chapter.

      Next comes the precise definition of a limit, written entirely in the language of this lesson: f(x) is close to L
      whenever x is close enough to a. In Real Analysis II: Metric Spaces and Analysis in Rⁿ, distance itself becomes the
      object of study, and the triangle inequality becomes one of the axioms that define it.
