      <p>
        To get dressed you must put on socks before shoes, and a shirt before a tie. But there is no rule about socks and the
        shirt: either can come first. Some tasks must be done in order; others are simply not comparable.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, any two whole numbers can be compared: one is smaller, or they are equal. What separates an ordering in
        which everything is comparable from one in which some pairs are not, and why is the second kind so common?
      </p>
    </>

  intuition: (

      <p>
        &ldquo;Before&rdquo; on the dressing tasks, &ldquo;is a subset of&rdquo; on sets, and &ldquo;divides&rdquo; on the
        positive integers all share three properties: everything comes before or equals itself, two different things cannot
        each come before the other, and before passes along chains. But in each, some pairs are incomparable.

        Below are the divisors of a number, ordered by divisibility. Each line goes up from a number to a multiple of it, with
        nothing in between. Click a number to see which others it can be compared with. Which choice of n gives a single
        chain?

      <Definition title="partial order">
        <p>
          A <strong>partial order</strong> on a set P is a relation <M>{"\\preceq"}</M> that is reflexive, antisymmetric and
          transitive. The pair <M>{"(P, \\preceq)"}</M> is a <strong>partially ordered set</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>poset</strong>. Elements a and b are <strong>comparable</strong> if <M>{"a \\preceq b"}</M> or{" "}
          <M>{"b \\preceq a"}</M>, and <strong>incomparable</strong> otherwise.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Definition title="total order">
        <p>
          A partial order is a <strong>total order</strong> (or linear order) if every two elements are comparable. A{" "}
          <strong>chain</strong> in a poset is a subset on which the order is total.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="three posets">
        <ul>
          <li><M>{"(\\mathbb{R}, \\le)"}</M> is a total order.</li>
          <li>
            The subsets of a set S under <M>{"\\subseteq"}</M> form a poset; <M>{"\\{1\\}"}</M> and <M>{"\\{2\\}"}</M> are
            incomparable whenever <M>{"S"}</M> contains 1 and 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            The positive integers under divisibility form a poset: antisymmetry holds because if <M>{"a \\mid b"}</M> and{" "}
            <M>{"b \\mid a"}</M> with both positive, then <M>{"a \\le b \\le a"}</M>. On all the integers it fails, since{" "}
            <M>{"2 \\mid -2"}</M> and <M>{"-2 \\mid 2"}</M>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="least, greatest, minimal, maximal">
        <p>
          In a poset, a <strong>least</strong> element lies below every element, while a <strong>minimal</strong> element has
          nothing strictly below it. In a total order the two notions agree, but not in general: in{" "}
          <M>{"\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\}"}</M> under divisibility, 2 and 3 are both minimal, and there is no least element.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="Hasse diagrams">
        <p>
          A finite poset can be drawn by putting a above b and joining them with a line when <M>{"b \\prec a"}</M> with nothing
          strictly in between. The rest of the order is recovered by transitivity: going upwards along lines. Such pictures are
          named after the number theorist Helmut Hasse.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="well-orders">
        <p>
          A total order is a <strong>well-order</strong> if every non-empty subset has a least element. By the well-ordering
          principle, <M>{"(\\mathbb{N}, \\le)"}</M> is one; <M>{"(\\mathbb{Z}, \\le)"}</M> and <M>{"([0, 1], \\le)"}</M> are
          not. Well-orders are exactly the orders that support proof by induction, and their study leads to the ordinals of set
          theory.

    <p>
      This completes the chapter on relations. The next chapter shows that a function is a special kind of relation. The order
      axioms of the real numbers open Calculus, and well-orders grow into the ordinals and Zorn&rsquo;s lemma in set theory.
