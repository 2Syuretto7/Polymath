  puzzle: (

      <p>
        The function <M>{"f(x) = x^2"}</M> has no inverse on the real numbers, since 9 comes from both 3 and{" "}
        <M>{"-3"}</M>. Yet the question &ldquo;which inputs give an output between 4 and 9?&rdquo; still has a perfectly good
        answer: those x with <M>{"2 \\le |x| \\le 3"}</M>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So some kind of backwards question always makes sense, even when a function cannot be undone. What is it, and how
        does it differ from a true inverse?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Apply a function to a whole set of inputs at once and you get the set of outputs it reaches: the <strong>image</strong>.
        Ask which inputs land in a chosen set of outputs and you get the <strong>preimage</strong>. The preimage never needs
        an inverse; it simply collects every input whose arrow lands in the chosen set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, <M>{"f(x) = x^2"}</M> maps <M>{"\\{-2, \\dots, 2\\}"}</M> into <M>{"\\{0, \\dots, 5\\}"}</M>. Choose a set,
        then go there and back again. Do you always return to where you started?

      <Definition title="image and preimage">
        <p>Let <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M>, <M>{"S \\subseteq A"}</M> and <M>{"T \\subseteq B"}</M>.</p>
        <MD>{"f(S) = \\{\\, f(s) : s \\in S \\,\\} \\subseteq B, \\qquad f^{-1}(T) = \\{\\, a \\in A : f(a) \\in T \\,\\} \\subseteq A."}</MD>
        <p>
          <M>{"f(S)"}</M> is the <strong>image</strong> of S and <M>{"f^{-1}(T)"}</M> the <strong>preimage</strong> (or inverse
          image) of T. The image of the whole domain, <M>{"f(A)"}</M>, is called the image or range of f.

      </Definition>

      <Remark title="a warning about notation">
        <p>
          The symbol <M>{"f^{-1}(T)"}</M> is defined for every function, invertible or not, and it is always a set. When f does
          happen to be a bijection, <M>{"f^{-1}(\\{b\\})"}</M> is the one-element set <M>{"\\{f^{-1}(b)\\}"}</M>, so the two
          uses agree. For <M>{"f(x) = x^2"}</M> on <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"f^{-1}(\\{9\\}) = \\{-3, 3\\}"}</M> and <M>{"f^{-1}(\\{-1\\}) = \\varnothing"}</M>.

      <Theorem title="preimages respect set operations">
        <p>For any <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M> and <M>{"T_1, T_2 \\subseteq B"}</M>,</p>
        <MD>{"f^{-1}(T_1 \\cup T_2) = f^{-1}(T_1) \\cup f^{-1}(T_2), \\qquad f^{-1}(T_1 \\cap T_2) = f^{-1}(T_1) \\cap f^{-1}(T_2),"}</MD>
        <p>and <M>{"f^{-1}(B \\setminus T_1) = A \\setminus f^{-1}(T_1)"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          For the intersection: <M>{"a \\in f^{-1}(T_1 \\cap T_2)"}</M> if and only if <M>{"f(a) \\in T_1"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"f(a) \\in T_2"}</M>, if and only if <M>{"a \\in f^{-1}(T_1)"}</M> and <M>{"a \\in f^{-1}(T_2)"}</M>. The other
          two are proved the same way, with &ldquo;or&rdquo; and &ldquo;not&rdquo;.

      </Proof>

      <Example title="images are less well behaved">
        <p>
          Images respect unions, <M>{"f(S_1 \\cup S_2) = f(S_1) \\cup f(S_2)"}</M>, but not intersections. With{" "}
          <M>{"f(x) = x^2"}</M>, <M>{"S_1 = \\{-1\\}"}</M> and <M>{"S_2 = \\{1\\}"}</M>:

        <MD>{"f(S_1 \\cap S_2) = f(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing, \\quad \\text{but} \\quad f(S_1) \\cap f(S_2) = \\{1\\}."}</MD>
        <p>In general only <M>{"f(S_1 \\cap S_2) \\subseteq f(S_1) \\cap f(S_2)"}</M> holds, with equality for all sets exactly when f is injective.</p>
      </Example>

      <Theorem title="there and back again">
        <p>For every <M>{"S \\subseteq A"}</M> and <M>{"T \\subseteq B"}</M>,</p>
        <MD>{"S \\subseteq f^{-1}(f(S)) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad f(f^{-1}(T)) \\subseteq T."}</MD>
        <p>The first is always an equality when f is injective, and the second when f is surjective.</p>

      <Remark title="why preimages matter">
        <p>
          Because preimages behave so well, many advanced definitions are phrased with them. In topology, a function is
          continuous when the preimage of every open set is open; in measure theory, a function is measurable when the preimage
          of every interval is measurable. Both definitions begin here.

      This completes the chapter on functions. The last chapter of the course uses bijections to compare the sizes of
      infinite sets, with startling results. Continuity in Topology and measurability in Measure and Integration are both
      defined through preimages.
