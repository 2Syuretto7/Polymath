      <p>
        Among all numbers strictly between 0 and 1, which is the largest? There is none: whatever you choose, there is a
        larger one still below 1. So the simple function <M>{"f(x) = x"}</M>, on the open interval <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M>, has
        no maximum value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimisation problems ask for the largest or smallest value of something: the most profit, the least material. When
        can we be sure the best value is actually reached, and not merely approached?

  intuition: (

      <p>
        The answer is a theorem with three hypotheses: the function is continuous, and the interval is both closed (it
        contains its endpoints) and bounded. Under those conditions, the function reaches a highest and a lowest value.
        Drop any one hypothesis and the conclusion can fail. Each case below drops one.

      <Definition title="maximum and minimum">
        <p>
          f <strong>attains a maximum</strong> on a set D at a point c in D if <M>{"f(x) \\le f(c)"}</M> for every x in D.
          Minimum is defined likewise. f is <strong>bounded</strong> on D if there is an M with <M>{"|f(x)| \\le M"}</M> for
          every x in D.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="boundedness">
        <p>
          If f is continuous on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>, then f is bounded on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let S be the set of x in <M>{"[a, b]"}</M> such that f is bounded on <M>{"[a, x]"}</M>. S contains a, and is bounded
          above by b; let <M>{"s = \\sup S"}</M>. By continuity at s (one-sided if <M>{"s = b"}</M>), with{" "}
          <M>{"\\varepsilon = 1"}</M>, there is a <M>{"\\delta > 0"}</M> such that <M>{"|f(x)| < |f(s)| + 1"}</M> for x in{" "}
          <M>{"[a, b]"}</M> within <M>{"\\delta"}</M> of s.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the approximation property, some <M>{"x_0 \\in S"}</M> has <M>{"x_0 > s - \\delta"}</M>. Then f is bounded on{" "}
          <M>{"[a, x_0]"}</M>, and on <M>{"[x_0, \\min(s + \\delta/2, b)]"}</M> by <M>{"|f(s)| + 1"}</M>, so f is bounded on{" "}
          <M>{"[a, \\min(s + \\delta/2, b)]"}</M>. If <M>{"s < b"}</M>, this puts a point larger than s in S, which is
          impossible. So <M>{"s = b"}</M>, and the same argument shows b itself is in S.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the extreme value theorem">
        <p>
          If f is continuous on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>, then f attains a maximum and a minimum on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          By the last theorem, the set of values <M>{"\\{f(x) : a \\le x \\le b\\}"}</M> is bounded above, so it has a
          supremum M. Suppose, for contradiction, that <M>{"f(x) < M"}</M> for every x in <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"g(x) = 1/(M - f(x))"}</M> is continuous on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>, since the denominator is never 0, so g is bounded,
          say by K. But by the approximation property, f(x) comes within any distance of M, so <M>{"M - f(x)"}</M> can be made
          smaller than <M>{"1/K"}</M>, making <M>{"g(x) > K"}</M>. This contradiction shows <M>{"f(c) = M"}</M> for some c.
          For the minimum, apply this to <M>{"-f"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="each hypothesis matters">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Not closed: <M>{"x"}</M> on <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M> has supremum 1 but no maximum, and <M>{"1/x"}</M> on{" "}
            <M>{"(0, 1]"}</M> is not even bounded.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not bounded: <M>{"x"}</M> on <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M> has no maximum.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not continuous: the jump in the visualisation has supremum 1 on <M>{"[0, 2]"}</M>, never attained.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The completeness of the reals is hidden in both proofs, through suprema. If only rational numbers existed,{" "}
          <M>{"-(x^2 - 2)^2"}</M> on <M>{"[0, 2]"}</M> would have supremum 0 and never reach it, since it is 0 only at the
          irrational <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M>.

      <Example title="a guarantee for optimisation">
        <p>
          A rectangle has its base on the x-axis and its top corners on the parabola <M>{"y = 4 - x^2"}</M>. Its area is{" "}
          <M>{"A(x) = 2x(4 - x^2)"}</M>, where <M>{"0 \\le x \\le 2"}</M>. A is continuous on the closed, bounded interval{" "}
          <M>{"[0, 2]"}</M>, so the theorem guarantees a largest rectangle before we look for it. (Allowing the degenerate
          rectangles at <M>{"x = 0"}</M> and <M>{"x = 2"}</M>, with area 0, is what makes the interval closed.) Derivatives
          will find it later in the course.

      Real Analysis I reveals what makes closed, bounded intervals special: they are compact, and continuous functions on
      compact sets always attain their extremes. Later in this course, optimisation problems will find the extremes that this
