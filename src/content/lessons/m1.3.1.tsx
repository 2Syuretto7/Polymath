  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>Add some pairs of odd numbers: 3 + 5, 7 + 11, 13 + 21, 99 + 1.</p>
      <p>
        Every answer is even. You could check a million more pairs and they would all come out even. But checking is not
        proving, as the polynomial <M>{"n^2 + n + 41"}</M> taught you. How could you be <em>certain</em> that the sum of any
        two odd numbers, including ones nobody will ever write down, is even?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Think of an odd number as a collection of pairs with one left over. Two odd numbers bring two leftovers, and the two
        leftovers make a pair. Nothing is left over, so the sum is even. Try it below with different numbers.
      </p>
      <OddSumViz />
      <p>
        That picture is already a proof, because it does not depend on which odd numbers you picked. The algebra below says
        the same thing in a form that can be checked line by line: write each odd number as <M>{"2k + 1"}</M>, add, and
        regroup.

      <Definition title="even, odd, divides">
        <p>An integer n is <strong>even</strong> if <M>{"n = 2k"}</M> for some integer k, and <strong>odd</strong> if <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M> for some integer k.</p>
        <p>
          For integers a and b, <strong>a divides b</strong>, written <M>{"a \\mid b"}</M>, if <M>{"b = ak"}</M> for some
          integer k. So 3 divides 12 because <M>{"12 = 3 \\cdot 4"}</M>.

      <Theorem title="sum of two odd numbers">
        <p>If m and n are odd, then m + n is even.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let m and n be odd. By definition there are integers j and k with <M>{"m = 2j + 1"}</M> and <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M>.
          Then
        </p>
        <MD>{"m + n = 2j + 1 + 2k + 1 = 2(j + k + 1)."}</MD>
        <p>Since j + k + 1 is an integer, m + n is even.</p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="unpack, compute, repack">
        <p>
          Most first proofs have the same shape. <strong>Unpack</strong> the hypothesis into its definition (odd means{" "}
          <M>{"2k + 1"}</M>). <strong>Compute</strong> with what you now have. <strong>Repack</strong> the result into the
          definition of the conclusion (even means 2 times an integer). Before starting, write down what you have and what
          you want, both in unpacked form; the gap between them is the proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two small points matter. Use <em>different</em> letters for different numbers: writing <M>{"m = 2k + 1"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M> would secretly assume m = n. And say why the final bracket is an integer, since that is what
          the definition asks for.

      <Theorem title="divisibility is transitive">
        <p>For integers a, b, c: if <M>{"a \\mid b"}</M> and <M>{"b \\mid c"}</M>, then <M>{"a \\mid c"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"a \\mid b"}</M> and <M>{"b \\mid c"}</M>. Then <M>{"b = aj"}</M> and <M>{"c = bk"}</M> for some integers j
          and k. Substituting, <M>{"c = (aj)k = a(jk)"}</M>, and jk is an integer, so <M>{"a \\mid c"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="a proof about squares">
        <p>
          Claim: if n is odd then <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd. Unpack: <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M>. Compute:{" "}
          <M>{"n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1"}</M>. Repack: <M>{"n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1"}</M>, and <M>{"2k^2 + 2k"}</M> is an integer,
          so <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Some statements resist a direct attack: assuming the hypothesis gives you nothing useful to compute with. The next
      lesson shows the first way round this, proving the contrapositive instead. Divisibility, unpacked exactly as here, is
      the starting point of number theory in Discrete Mathematics and in Elementary Number Theory.
