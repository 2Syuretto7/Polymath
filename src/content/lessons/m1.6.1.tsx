        cannot. Some pass along a chain: if a is less than b and b is less than c, then a is less than c.

        Is &ldquo;is a sibling of&rdquo; like that? If Asha is Ravi&rsquo;s sibling and Ravi is Asha&rsquo;s sibling, does it

      <p>
        A relation on a set is completely described by listing which ordered pairs are linked. So mathematics simply{" "}
        <em>defines</em> a relation to be that list: a set of ordered pairs. All the meaning of &ldquo;divides&rdquo; on a
        small set is captured by which pairs <M>{"(a, b)"}</M> it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, a relation on <M>{"\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}"}</M> is drawn as a grid: a shaded square in row a and column b means a
        is related to b. Four properties are checked, each with a counterexample when it fails. Pick a relation, or click
        squares to build your own and try to make all four properties hold at once.

      <Definition title="relation">
        <p>
          A <strong>relation</strong> from a set A to a set B is a subset R of the Cartesian product <M>{"A \\times B"}</M>. We
          write <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} b"}</M> for <M>{"(a, b) \\in R"}</M>. A relation from A to A is called a relation{" "}
          <strong>on</strong> A.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Definition title="four properties">
        <p>A relation R on a set A is</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>reflexive</strong> if <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} a"}</M> for every <M>{"a \\in A"}</M>;</li>
          <li><strong>symmetric</strong> if <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} b"}</M> implies <M>{"b \\mathrel{R} a"}</M>;</li>
          <li><strong>antisymmetric</strong> if <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} b"}</M> and <M>{"b \\mathrel{R} a"}</M> together imply <M>{"a = b"}</M>;</li>
          <li><strong>transitive</strong> if <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} b"}</M> and <M>{"b \\mathrel{R} c"}</M> together imply <M>{"a \\mathrel{R} c"}</M>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each is a universally quantified statement, so a single counterexample shows it fails.</p>

      <Example title="the sibling puzzle">
        <p>
          Take &ldquo;is a sibling of&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;is a different person with the same parents&rdquo;. It is
          symmetric. It is not reflexive: nobody is their own sibling. And it is not transitive: Asha is Ravi&rsquo;s sibling
          and Ravi is Asha&rsquo;s, but Asha is not Asha&rsquo;s. The tempting argument
        </p>
        <MD>{"a \\mathrel{R} b \\text{ and } b \\mathrel{R} a \\implies a \\mathrel{R} a"}</MD>
        <p>
          uses transitivity with <M>{"c = a"}</M>, so it only shows that a symmetric, transitive relation is reflexive at
          every a that is related to <em>something</em>. That is not the same as reflexive.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="symmetric and antisymmetric are not opposites">
        <p>
          Equality on any set is both symmetric and antisymmetric. The relation <M>{"\\{(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)\\}"}</M> on{" "}
          <M>{"\\{1, 2, 3\\}"}</M> is neither. Antisymmetric does not mean &ldquo;not symmetric&rdquo;: it says that two{" "}
          <em>different</em> elements are never related both ways.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="the properties of familiar relations">
        <p>
          On the positive integers: <M>{"\\le"}</M> is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. <M>{"<"}</M> is antisymmetric
          (vacuously, since <M>{"a < b"}</M> and <M>{"b < a"}</M> never both hold) and transitive, but not reflexive. Divides is
          reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. &ldquo;Has the same parity as&rdquo; is reflexive, symmetric and
          transitive. These two patterns are the subjects of the next two lessons.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Relations that are reflexive, symmetric and transitive behave like &ldquo;is the same as, in some respect&rdquo;, and
      they cut a set into pieces: that is the next lesson. Relations are the edges of graphs in Discrete Mathematics, and the
      structures of first-order logic are sets equipped with relations.
