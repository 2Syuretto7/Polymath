  puzzle: (

      <p>
        A hotel has infinitely many rooms, numbered 1, 2, 3, &hellip;, and every room is occupied. A new guest arrives. The
        manager is not worried, and asks every guest to move from room n to room <M>{"n + 1"}</M>. Room 1 is now free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then a coach arrives with infinitely many new guests. Can the full hotel still take them all? And what about
        infinitely many coaches, each carrying infinitely many guests?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        For the coach, move each guest from room n to room 2n; the odd-numbered rooms are now free for the newcomers. The
        story, told by David Hilbert in the 1920s, makes the point of Galileo&rsquo;s paradox vivid: an infinite set can be
        matched with a part of itself.

      <p>
        A set that can be listed as a first, second, third element, and so on, with every element appearing somewhere, is
        called countable. Below are four such lists. The last two need a trick, and the trick also solves the problem of
        infinitely many coaches.

      <Definition title="countable sets">
        <p>
          A set A is <strong>countably infinite</strong> if there is a bijection <M>{"\\mathbb{N} \\to A"}</M>, where{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}"}</M>. Such a bijection lists A as <M>{"a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots"}</M> without
          repetition. A set is <strong>countable</strong> if it is finite or countably infinite.

      <Example title="the integers">
        <p>The function</p>
        <MD>{"f(n) = \\begin{cases} (n + 1)/2 & n \\text{ odd} \\\\ -n/2 & n \\text{ even} \\end{cases}"}</MD>
        <p>lists the integers as 0, 1, <M>{"-1"}</M>, 2, <M>{"-2"}</M>, &hellip; and is a bijection <M>{"\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{Z}"}</M>.</p>

      <Theorem title="pairs of natural numbers">
        <p><M>{"\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}"}</M> is countable.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          List the pairs <M>{"(m, n)"}</M> by the diagonals <M>{"m + n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots"}</M>, and within each diagonal by
          increasing m. The diagonal <M>{"m + n = s"}</M> has <M>{"s + 1"}</M> pairs, and the diagonals before it have{" "}
          <M>{"1 + 2 + \\cdots + s = s(s + 1)/2"}</M> pairs in all. So <M>{"(m, n)"}</M> is in position

          counting from 0. Every pair has a position, and different pairs have different positions, so this is a bijection{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}"}</M>, with inverse listing the pairs.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="useful facts">
        <ol>
          <li>Every subset of a countable set is countable.</li>
          <li>If there is a surjection from a countable set onto A, then A is countable.</li>
          <li>The rational numbers are countable.</li>
        </ol>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          (1) List the countable set and delete the elements not in the subset; what remains is a finite list or an infinite
          list without repeats. (2) If <M>{"g : C \\to A"}</M> is onto, list C and replace each element c by{" "}
          <M>{"g(c)"}</M>; deleting repeats lists A. (3) The map <M>{"(p, q) \\mapsto p/(q + 1)"}</M> from{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{N}"}</M> onto <M>{"\\mathbb{Q}"}</M> is surjective, and{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{N}"}</M> is countable by the theorem on pairs, since <M>{"\\mathbb{Z}"}</M> is.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="infinitely many coaches">
        <p>
          Put the guest in seat n of coach m into room <M>{"\\pi(m, n)"}</M> after moving the residents to the even rooms, and
          everyone fits. The same idea shows that a countable union of countable sets is countable, though for infinitely many
          sets the proof must choose a listing of each one at once: a first appearance of the axiom of choice.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Remark title="dense yet countable">
        <p>
          The rationals are packed densely on the number line: between any two lies a third. Yet they can be listed, one after
          another, as the visualisation shows. How crowded a set looks says nothing about how many elements it has. That raises
          the obvious question: is every infinite set countable?

      Is every infinite set countable? The next lesson gives Cantor&rsquo;s famous answer: no, and the real numbers are the
      first example. Countability returns in Real Analysis and Topology, and countable sets are the first infinite cardinals of
      set theory.
