      <p>Is there a real number x with <M>{"x^3 + x = 1"}</M>?</p>
      <p>
        You cannot easily solve it: there is a formula for cubic equations, but it is long and few people remember it. Yet it
        is possible to prove, in a few lines and without finding x, that there is <em>exactly one</em> such number. How can
        you know a number exists, and that there is only one, without ever writing it down?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Let <M>{"f(x) = x^3 + x - 1"}</M>. Then <M>{"f(0) = -1"}</M> is below zero and <M>{"f(1) = 1"}</M> is above. A
        smooth, unbroken graph that starts below the axis and ends above it must cross the axis somewhere in between. That
        proves <strong>existence</strong>. And f is increasing everywhere, so once it has crossed it can never come back:
        that proves <strong>uniqueness</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, you can also close in on the root by repeatedly halving the interval and keeping the half where the sign
        changes. Halving never finds the root exactly, but it traps it as tightly as you like.

          <M>{"\\exists!\\, x\\, P(x)"}</M>, read &ldquo;there exists a unique x such that P(x)&rdquo;, means

          So it is proved in two parts. <strong>Existence:</strong> show that some x works. <strong>Uniqueness:</strong>{" "}

      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <em>Existence.</em> Let <M>{"x = -b/a"}</M>, which makes sense as <M>{"a \\ne 0"}</M>. Then{" "}

          Since <M>{"a \\ne 0"}</M>, we can divide by a to get <M>{"x - y = 0"}</M>, so <M>{"x = y"}</M>.

          A <strong>constructive</strong> existence proof exhibits a witness, as above. A{" "}
          <strong>non-constructive</strong> proof shows that something exists without saying which thing it is. The cubic in
          the puzzle is half-way: the sign-change argument does not name the root, though bisection lets you compute it to any
          accuracy you like.

      <Theorem title="an irrational power can be rational">
        <p>There are irrational numbers a and b such that <M>{"a^b"}</M> is rational.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Consider <M>{"\\sqrt 2^{\\sqrt 2}"}</M>. It is either rational or irrational. If it is rational, take{" "}
          <M>{"a = b = \\sqrt 2"}</M>. If it is irrational, take <M>{"a = \\sqrt 2^{\\sqrt 2}"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"b = \\sqrt 2"}</M>; then
        </p>
        <MD>{"a^b = \\big(\\sqrt 2^{\\sqrt 2}\\big)^{\\sqrt 2} = \\sqrt 2^{\\sqrt 2 \\cdot \\sqrt 2} = \\sqrt 2^{\\,2} = 2."}</MD>
        <p>Either way, the required pair exists.</p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="a proof some mathematicians reject">
        <p>
          The proof above is complete, yet at its end you still do not know which pair works. (In fact{" "}
          <M>{"\\sqrt 2^{\\sqrt 2}"}</M> is irrational, but that needs a deep theorem proved in the 1930s.) The Dutch mathematician
          L. E. J. Brouwer held that such proofs, which rely on &ldquo;either P or not P&rdquo; without knowing which, do not
          really establish existence. His school, <strong>intuitionism</strong>, accepts an existence claim only when a
          witness can be constructed. Most mathematicians accept non-constructive proofs, but the debate shaped modern logic
          and computer science.

      </Remark>

      <Remark title="why uniqueness matters">
        <p>
          Uniqueness is what lets us say <em>the</em> solution, and give it a name. When we write <M>{"\\sqrt 2"}</M>, we rely
          on there being exactly one positive number whose square is 2. In the course on differential equations, a theorem of
          exactly this shape tells you when an equation of motion has one and only one future.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The step &ldquo;an unbroken graph from below to above must cross&rdquo; is the intermediate value theorem, which
      Calculus proves from the completeness of the real numbers. Bisection is the simplest root-finding method in Numerical
      Analysis, and existence-and-uniqueness theorems are a cornerstone of differential equations. Next: how to write all of
      this up so that a reader can follow it.
