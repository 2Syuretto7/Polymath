      <p>
        A newspaper reports: &ldquo;Prices are still rising, but more slowly than last month.&rdquo; Another says:
        &ldquo;The fall in sales is accelerating.&rdquo; Each sentence is about a quantity, how it changes, and how its
        change changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you knew only the derivative of a function, how much could you say about the shape of its graph? Where it rises,
        where it falls, where it turns, and which way it bends?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The sign of <M>{"f'"}</M> says whether the graph is rising or falling. The sign of <M>{"f''"}</M> says whether the
        slope itself is rising or falling: whether the graph bends upwards like a bowl or downwards like a cap. The first
        newspaper describes <M>{"f' > 0"}</M> and <M>{"f'' < 0"}</M>. Move the point below and watch the strips.

      <Definition title="increasing and decreasing">
        <p>
          f is <strong>increasing</strong> on an interval I if <M>{"x < y"}</M> implies <M>{"f(x) \\le f(y)"}</M> for x, y
          in I, and <strong>strictly increasing</strong> if it implies <M>{"f(x) < f(y)"}</M>. Decreasing is defined in the
          same way.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="the sign of the derivative">
        <p>
          Let f be continuous on an interval I and differentiable inside it. If <M>{"f' \\ge 0"}</M> inside I, f is
          increasing on I; if <M>{"f' > 0"}</M>, strictly increasing. Likewise for <M>{"f' \\le 0"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"f' < 0"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Take <M>{"x < y"}</M> in I. By the mean value theorem, <M>{"f(y) - f(x) = f'(c)(y - x)"}</M> for some c between
          them. The factor <M>{"y - x"}</M> is positive, so <M>{"f(y) - f(x)"}</M> has the sign of <M>{"f'(c)"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="the converse is weaker">
        <p>
          <M>{"x^3"}</M> is strictly increasing on all of ℝ, yet its derivative is 0 at 0. A strictly increasing
          differentiable function has <M>{"f' \\ge 0"}</M>, not necessarily <M>{"f' > 0"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Theorem title="the first derivative test">
        <p>
          Let c be a point where <M>{"f'(c) = 0"}</M>, with f differentiable near c. If <M>{"f'"}</M> is positive just
          to the left of c and negative just to the right, f has a local maximum at c. If it goes from negative to positive,
          a local minimum. If it does not change sign, neither.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>This follows at once from the last theorem: f rises up to c and falls after it, or the reverse.</p>

      <Definition title="convex and concave">
        <p>
          f is <strong>convex</strong> on I if every chord lies on or above the graph: for x, y in I and{" "}
          <M>{"0 \\le t \\le 1"}</M>,
        </p>
        <MD>{"f\\big(t x + (1 - t) y\\big) \\le t f(x) + (1 - t) f(y)."}</MD>
        <p>
          f is <strong>concave</strong> if every chord lies on or below the graph. A point where the graph changes from one
          to the other is an <strong>inflection point</strong>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="the sign of the second derivative">
        <p>
          If <M>{"f'' \\ge 0"}</M> on an open interval, f is convex there; if <M>{"f'' \\le 0"}</M>, concave.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Take <M>{"x < z < y"}</M>. By the mean value theorem, the chord from x to z has slope <M>{"f'(c_1)"}</M> and the
          chord from z to y has slope <M>{"f'(c_2)"}</M>, with <M>{"c_1 < z < c_2"}</M>. Since <M>{"f'' \\ge 0"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"f'"}</M> is increasing, so the first slope is at most the second. A path that climbs no faster on the left
          part than on the right part must pass at or below the straight line from <M>{"(x, f(x))"}</M> to{" "}
          <M>{"(y, f(y))"}</M>; writing this out with <M>{"z = tx + (1 - t)y"}</M> gives exactly the inequality in the
          definition.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the second derivative test">
        <p>
          If <M>{"f'(c) = 0"}</M> and <M>{"f''(c) > 0"}</M>, f has a local minimum at c. If <M>{"f'(c) = 0"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"f''(c) < 0"}</M>, a local maximum. If <M>{"f''(c) = 0"}</M>, the test says nothing.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        If <M>{"f''(c) > 0"}</M>, then <M>{"f'(c + h)/h = (f'(c + h) - f'(c))/h"}</M> tends to <M>{"f''(c)"}</M>, so it is
        positive for small <M>{"h \\ne 0"}</M>. Hence{" "}
        <M>{"f'"}</M> is negative just left of c and positive just right, and the first derivative test applies. The last
        sentence is shown by <M>{"x^4"}</M>, <M>{"-x^4"}</M> and <M>{"x^3"}</M> at 0: second derivative 0, and a minimum,
        a maximum, and neither.
      </p>

      <Example title="a cubic, completely">
        <p>
          For <M>{"f(x) = x^3 - 3x"}</M>: <M>{"f'(x) = 3(x - 1)(x + 1)"}</M>, positive outside <M>{"[-1, 1]"}</M> and
          negative inside. So f increases, then decreases, then increases, with a local maximum <M>{"f(-1) = 2"}</M> and a
          local minimum <M>{"f(1) = -2"}</M>. And <M>{"f''(x) = 6x"}</M>: concave for <M>{"x < 0"}</M>, convex for{" "}
          <M>{"x > 0"}</M>, with an inflection point at the origin. These few facts fix the shape of the graph.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="tangents and convexity">
        <p>
          A differentiable convex function lies above each of its tangent lines, as the visualisation shows. This simple
          picture gives many inequalities. For instance, <M>{"x^2 \\ge 2x - 1"}</M> because the right side is the tangent to{" "}
          <M>{"x^2"}</M> at 1. Later, the same idea gives the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means, and much of
          probability theory.

    <p>
      Convexity is one of the most useful ideas in mathematics. In Probability it becomes Jensen&rsquo;s inequality, which
      compares the average of a convex function with the function of the average. Real Analysis I studies monotone
      functions without assuming any derivative, and finds that they can jump only countably many times.
