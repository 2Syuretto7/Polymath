  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        You have a square sheet of card, 12 cm on each side. Cut a small square from each corner, fold up the four flaps,
        and you have an open box. Cut tiny squares and the box is a shallow tray; cut large ones and it is a narrow
        chimney with almost no base.
      </p>
      <p>Somewhere in between is the cut that holds the most. Where exactly, and how can you be sure it is the best?</p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        As the cut grows from 0 to 6, the volume starts at 0, rises, and falls back to 0. At the very top of the hump the
        graph is flat for an instant: rising has stopped and falling has not begun. So the best cut is where the derivative
        of the volume is 0. Try to find it by hand before revealing it.

      <Definition title="critical point">
        <p>
          A <strong>critical point</strong> of f is a point c in the interior of its domain where <M>{"f'(c) = 0"}</M> or{" "}
          <M>{"f'(c)"}</M> does not exist.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="the closed interval method">
        <p>
          If f is continuous on <M>{"[a, b]"}</M>, it has a largest and a smallest value there, and each occurs either at an
          endpoint or at a critical point. So to find them: list the critical points in <M>{"(a, b)"}</M>, evaluate f at
          these and at a and b, and compare.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        The extreme value theorem says the extremes exist. Fermat&rsquo;s theorem says that an extreme inside the interval,
        at a point where f is differentiable, has <M>{"f' = 0"}</M>. So every extreme is on the list.
      </p>

      <Example title="the box">
        <p>
          With cut x, the box has base <M>{"12 - 2x"}</M> by <M>{"12 - 2x"}</M> and height x, so{" "}
          <M>{"V(x) = x(12 - 2x)^2"}</M> on <M>{"[0, 6]"}</M>. By the product rule,
        </p>
        <MD>{"V'(x) = (12 - 2x)^2 - 4x(12 - 2x) = (12 - 2x)(12 - 6x),"}</MD>
        <p>
          which is 0 only at <M>{"x = 2"}</M> inside the interval. Compare: <M>{"V(0) = 0"}</M>, <M>{"V(6) = 0"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"V(2) = 2 \\cdot 8^2 = 128"}</M>. The best cut is 2 cm, giving 128 cubic centimetres.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="the cheapest can">
        <p>
          A can must hold a volume V. Which shape uses the least metal? With radius r and height h,{" "}
          <M>{"V = \\pi r^2 h"}</M>, so <M>{"h = V/(\\pi r^2)"}</M>, and the surface area is
        </p>
        <MD>{"A(r) = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h = 2\\pi r^2 + \\frac{2V}{r}, \\qquad r > 0."}</MD>
        <p>
          <M>{"A'(r) = 4\\pi r - 2V/r^2"}</M>, which is 0 when <M>{"r^3 = V/(2\\pi)"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"h = V/(\\pi r^2) = 2r"}</M>: the best can is as tall as it is wide. The domain{" "}
          <M>{"(0, \\infty)"}</M> is not closed, so the closed interval method does not apply directly. Instead,{" "}
          <M>{"A'"}</M> is negative before the critical point and positive after it, so A decreases and then increases, and
          the critical point gives the smallest value on the whole domain.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="a method for word problems">
        <ol>
          <li>Name the quantity to be made largest or smallest, and the variables it depends on.</li>
          <li>Use the constraints to write it as a function of one variable.</li>
          <li>Find the domain: which values make physical sense, including the endpoints.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>
          The third step is the one most often forgotten. A critical point is only a candidate, and the best value can be at
          an endpoint, as the practice questions show.

          For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect and the work of a most wise Creator, nothing at all takes
          place in the universe in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.

      <p>
        Euler&rsquo;s confidence was theological, but the physics has borne him out surprisingly often. Light travels
        between two points along the path that takes least time, and a hanging chain settles into the shape with the lowest
        centre of gravity.

      When the quantity depends on several variables tied together by a constraint, Multivariable Calculus and Vector
      Analysis replaces the single derivative by Lagrange multipliers. And when the unknown is a whole curve, such as the
      shape of a hanging chain, the problem belongs to the calculus of variations, which Graduate PDE takes up with the
      Euler-Lagrange equations.
