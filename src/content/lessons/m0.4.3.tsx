      <p>
        Start with 1 and keep doubling: 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. How many doublings does it take to pass one million? Now a
        harder version: how many doublings does it take to reach <em>exactly</em> 1000? Is that question even sensible, when
        1000 is not a power of 2?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Since <M>{"2^{10} = 1024"}</M>, ten doublings pass a thousand, and twenty pass a million, because{" "}
        <M>{"2^{20} = 1024^2 = 1{,}048{,}576"}</M>. Reaching exactly 1000 needs a little under ten doublings: there is a
        unique real number <M>x</M> with <M>{"2^x = 1000"}</M>, because <M>{"x \\mapsto 2^x"}</M> is one-to-one and takes
        every positive value. It is about 9.97.
      </p>
      <p>
        That number has a name: the <strong>logarithm</strong> of 1000 to base 2. A logarithm is an exponent, the answer
        to &ldquo;what power of the base gives this number?&rdquo;. Since it undoes an exponential function, its graph is
        the reflection in <M>{"y = x"}</M>, as for every inverse.

      <Definition title="logarithm">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"b > 0"}</M> with <M>{"b \\neq 1"}</M>. For <M>{"y > 0"}</M>, the <strong>logarithm</strong> of{" "}
          <M>y</M> to base <M>b</M>, written <M>{"\\log_b y"}</M>, is the unique real number <M>x</M> with{" "}
          <M>{"b^x = y"}</M>:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\log_b y = x \\iff b^x = y."}</MD>
      </Definition>
      <p>
        It exists and is unique because the exponential function is one-to-one with range all the positive reals. So{" "}
        <M>{"\\log_b"}</M> is defined only for positive numbers: no power of a positive base is zero or negative.
      </p>

      <Theorem title="logarithm and exponential are inverse">
        <p>For every real <M>x</M> and every <M>{"y > 0"}</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"\\log_b(b^x) = x \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad b^{\\log_b y} = y."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          The first: <M>{"\\log_b(b^x)"}</M> is the power of <M>b</M> that gives <M>{"b^x"}</M>, and that power is{" "}
          <M>x</M>, since exponentials are one-to-one. The second is the definition read aloud: <M>{"\\log_b y"}</M> is the
          power that, applied to <M>b</M>, gives <M>y</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <p>Some values follow straight from the definition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><M>{"\\log_b 1 = 0"}</M> and <M>{"\\log_b b = 1"}</M>, because <M>{"b^0 = 1"}</M> and <M>{"b^1 = b"}</M>;</li>
        <li><M>{"\\log_2 32 = 5"}</M>, <M>{"\\log_{10} 0.001 = -3"}</M> and <M>{"\\log_9 3 = \\tfrac12"}</M>;</li>
        <li>for <M>{"b > 1"}</M>, <M>{"\\log_b"}</M> is increasing, negative on <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M> and positive beyond 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The base-10 logarithm is the <strong>common logarithm</strong>, often written <M>{"\\log"}</M> alone. The logarithm
        to base <M>e</M>, the natural logarithm <M>{"\\ln"}</M>, arrives at the end of this chapter.

      <Proposition title="counting digits">
        <p>A whole number <M>{"N \\ge 1"}</M> has <M>{"\\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor + 1"}</M> digits.</p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>N</M> has <M>k</M> digits exactly when <M>{"10^{k-1} \\le N < 10^k"}</M>. Since <M>{"\\log_{10}"}</M> is
          increasing, this is equivalent to <M>{"k - 1 \\le \\log_{10} N < k"}</M>, which says{" "}
          <M>{"\\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor = k - 1"}</M>.

      <Example title="dating a bone">
        <p>
          A bone retains 30 percent of the carbon-14 it had in life, and the half-life is 5730 years. After <M>t</M> years
          the fraction remaining is <M>{"(\\tfrac12)^{t/5730}"}</M>. Setting this equal to 0.3 and taking logarithms to base{" "}
          <M>{"\\tfrac12"}</M>:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{t}{5730} = \\log_{1/2} 0.3, \\qquad t = 5730 \\log_{1/2} 0.3 \\approx 5730 \\times 1.737 \\approx 9950."}</MD>
        <p>
          The bone is about 10,000 years old. Calculators offer only <M>{"\\log_{10}"}</M> and <M>{"\\ln"}</M>; the next
          lesson shows how to get any other base from those.

      <Remark title="logarithmic scales">
        <p>
          When quantities range over many powers of ten, we measure them by their logarithms. The decibel scale for sound, the
          pH scale for acidity and the magnitude scale for stars all work this way: a step of 1 on such a scale means
          multiplying by a fixed factor, not adding a fixed amount. Logarithms turn the geometric world into an arithmetic
          one, which is why they were invented.

      Next, the laws of logarithms, which turn multiplication into addition and powered the slide rules and astronomy of
      three centuries. In Calculus, the natural logarithm is redefined as an area under a curve. Logarithms reappear in
      Discrete Mathematics, where they count the steps of efficient algorithms, and in Probability, in the densities of
      common distributions.
