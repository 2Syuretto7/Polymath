      <p>
        We write <M>{"n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots n"}</M>. But what do the three dots mean? They say &ldquo;and so
        on&rdquo;, trusting the reader to guess the pattern. A computer cannot guess, and neither should a proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you define <M>{"n!"}</M> for every natural number n precisely, in a finite number of words, without any dots at
        all?

      <p>
        Give a starting value and a rule for getting each value from the one before: <M>{"0! = 1"}</M>, and{" "}
        <M>{"(n + 1)! = (n + 1) \\cdot n!"}</M>. From these two lines, <M>{"1! = 1"}</M>, <M>{"2! = 2"}</M>,{" "}
        <M>{"3! = 6"}</M>, and so on, with no guessing needed. This is a <strong>recursive definition</strong>, and it is
        induction used for building rather than proving.

      <Definition title="recursive definition of a sequence">
        <p>A sequence <M>{"a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots"}</M> is <strong>defined recursively</strong> by giving</p>
        <ol>
          <li>one or more <strong>initial values</strong>, such as <M>{"a_0"}</M>, and</li>
          <li>a <strong>recurrence</strong>: a rule giving <M>{"a_{n+1}"}</M> in terms of earlier terms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Induction guarantees that this defines <M>{"a_n"}</M> for every n, and only one way: this is the{" "}
          <strong>recursion theorem</strong>.

      <Example title="defining sums and powers">
        <p>
          The sigma notation is itself recursive: <M>{"\\sum_{i=1}^{0} x_i = 0"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + x_{n+1}"}</M>. So are powers: <M>{"x^0 = 1"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"x^{n+1} = x^n \\cdot x"}</M>. Every &ldquo;and so on&rdquo; in mathematics can be made precise this way.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Theorem title="solving a recurrence">
        <p>If <M>{"a_0 = 0"}</M> and <M>{"a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1"}</M>, then <M>{"a_n = 2^n - 1"}</M> for every n.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          By induction. <M>{"a_0 = 0 = 2^0 - 1"}</M>. If <M>{"a_k = 2^k - 1"}</M>, then{" "}
          <M>{"a_{k+1} = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        This is the usual pattern: compute some terms, guess a formula, and prove it by induction. Recursion and induction
        are two sides of one coin.
      </p>

      <Definition title="recursive definitions of sets">
        <p>
          Sets can be defined recursively too. The <strong>formulas</strong> of propositional logic are given by: every letter
          P, Q, R, &hellip; is a formula; if A and B are formulas, so are <M>{"\\neg A"}</M>, <M>{"(A \\wedge B)"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"(A \\vee B)"}</M> and <M>{"(A \\to B)"}</M>; and nothing else is a formula. To prove something about every
          formula, use <strong>structural induction</strong>: show it holds for letters, and that each building rule preserves
          it.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="balanced brackets">
        <p>
          Every formula has as many left brackets as right brackets. Letters have none of either. <M>{"\\neg A"}</M> has the
          same brackets as A. <M>{"(A \\wedge B)"}</M> adds one of each to those of A and B, which balance by assumption. So by
          structural induction, every formula is balanced.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="the Collatz problem">
        <p>
          Start with any positive integer; halve it if even, triple it and add one if odd; repeat. Lothar Collatz asked in 1937
          whether you always reach 1. Every starting number ever tested, into the quintillions, does. Nobody has proved it.
          The recursion is completely clear; whether it always ends is not. Paul Erdős is said to have remarked that
          mathematics is not yet ready for such problems.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      This completes the chapter on induction. Next come relations: ways of linking the elements of sets, such as
      &ldquo;less than&rdquo; and &ldquo;has the same remainder as&rdquo;. Recurrences are solved systematically in Discrete
      Mathematics, recursion is the heart of algorithms, and the recursive definition of formulas is where formal logic
      begins.
