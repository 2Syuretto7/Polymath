      <p>
        Before calculators, astronomers spent weeks multiplying long numbers by hand: <M>{"3{,}782{,}511 \\times 6{,}409{,}327"}</M>,
        over and over, to predict where the planets would be. Adding such numbers is quick; multiplying them is slow and
        error-prone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a way to turn multiplication into addition? Look at the powers of 2: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. Multiply 8
        by 16. What do you notice about the exponents?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        <M>{"8 \\times 16 = 2^3 \\times 2^4 = 2^7 = 128"}</M>. To multiply two powers, add their exponents. So if every
        number could be written as a power of one fixed base, multiplication would become addition of exponents, and a
        table of exponents would replace long multiplication. The exponents are logarithms.
      </p>

        In 1614 John Napier published the first tables of logarithms, and within a few years Henry Briggs had produced
        tables to base 10. Johannes Kepler used them for his planetary calculations. The slide rule, invented soon after, puts
        the idea into a ruler: mark each number at a distance equal to its logarithm, and sliding one scale along another adds
        lengths, which multiplies numbers. Try it.

      <Theorem title="the laws of logarithms">
        <p>Let <M>{"b > 0"}</M>, <M>{"b \\neq 1"}</M>. For all <M>{"x, y > 0"}</M> and every real <M>r</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"\\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\qquad \\log_b \\frac{x}{y} = \\log_b x - \\log_b y, \\qquad \\log_b(x^r) = r \\log_b x."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let <M>{"u = \\log_b x"}</M> and <M>{"v = \\log_b y"}</M>, so <M>{"x = b^u"}</M> and <M>{"y = b^v"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"xy = b^u b^v = b^{u + v}"}</M>, so <M>{"\\log_b(xy) = u + v"}</M>. Similarly{" "}
          <M>{"\\tfrac{x}{y} = b^{u - v}"}</M>, and <M>{"x^r = (b^u)^r = b^{ru}"}</M>, so{" "}
          <M>{"\\log_b(x^r) = ru"}</M>. Each law of logarithms is a law of exponents, read backwards.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="change of base">
        <p>For bases <M>b</M> and <M>c</M> (positive, not 1) and every <M>{"x > 0"}</M>,</p>
        <MD>{"\\log_b x = \\frac{\\log_c x}{\\log_c b}."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let <M>{"u = \\log_b x"}</M>, so <M>{"b^u = x"}</M>. Take <M>{"\\log_c"}</M> of both sides and use the power law:{" "}
          <M>{"u \\log_c b = \\log_c x"}</M>. Since <M>{"b \\neq 1"}</M>, <M>{"\\log_c b \\neq 0"}</M>, and we can divide.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>So one table, or one calculator button, gives logarithms to every base.</p>

      <Example title="solving exponential equations">
        <p>Solve <M>{"3^x = 20"}</M>. Take common logarithms of both sides:</p>
        <MD>{"x \\log 3 = \\log 20, \\qquad x = \\frac{\\log 20}{\\log 3} \\approx \\frac{1.3010}{0.4771} \\approx 2.727."}</MD>
        <p>
          Check: <M>{"3^{2.727}"}</M> lies between <M>{"3^2 = 9"}</M> and <M>{"3^3 = 27"}</M>, nearer the top, as it should.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="doubling time">
        <p>
          Money growing at <M>p</M> percent a year doubles after <M>n</M> years, where <M>{"(1 + \\tfrac{p}{100})^n = 2"}</M>.
          So <M>{"n = \\dfrac{\\log 2}{\\log(1 + p/100)}"}</M>. At 7 percent, <M>{"n = \\tfrac{0.3010}{0.0294} \\approx 10.2"}</M>{" "}
          years. Bankers&rsquo; rule of thumb, &ldquo;divide 70 by the percentage&rdquo;, gives 10; the end of this chapter
          explains why it works.

      <Definition title="what logarithms do not do">
        <p>There is no law for the logarithm of a sum. In general</p>
        <MD>{"\\log(x + y) \\neq \\log x + \\log y, \\qquad \\log(x)\\log(y) \\neq \\log(xy), \\qquad \\frac{\\log x}{\\log y} \\neq \\log \\frac{x}{y}."}</MD>
        <p>Test with <M>{"x = y = 10"}</M>: <M>{"\\log 20 \\approx 1.30"}</M>, but <M>{"\\log 10 + \\log 10 = 2"}</M>.</p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="an early isomorphism">
        <p>
          The first law says that the logarithm turns the positive numbers under multiplication into all real numbers under
          addition, matching one structure exactly with the other. In Abstract Algebra such a structure-preserving
          correspondence is called an isomorphism of groups, and this is the first example most mathematicians ever meet.

      Next, the number <M>e</M> and continuous growth, where a natural base for logarithms appears from compound interest.
      In Calculus, the laws of logarithms make differentiation of products and powers easy, through logarithmic
