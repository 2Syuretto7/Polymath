      <p>
        A country issues only two stamps, worth ₹4 and ₹5. Which postage amounts can be paid exactly? ₹8 can (4 + 4), ₹9 can
        (4 + 5), but ₹11 cannot. Work out a few more.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should find that from ₹12 onwards, every amount seems possible. Why? And how would you prove it for every amount,
        when knowing how to pay ₹k does not obviously tell you how to pay ₹(k + 1)?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Knowing ₹k does not help directly, but knowing ₹(k − 3) does: add a ₹4 stamp to pay ₹(k + 1). So once the four
        amounts ₹12, ₹13, ₹14, ₹15 are possible, every later amount follows, each from the one four places before it.

        This is <strong>strong induction</strong>: to prove the next case you may assume <em>all</em> earlier cases, not just
        the last one. Below is the most important example. Every whole number above 1 is a product of primes, because a
        number that is not prime splits into two smaller numbers, and both of those are covered by earlier cases.

      <Definition title="the principle of strong induction">
        <p>Let <M>{"P(n)"}</M> be a statement about natural numbers <M>{"n \\ge a"}</M>. Suppose that for every <M>{"k \\ge a"}</M>,</p>
        <MD>{"\\text{if } P(a), P(a + 1), \\dots, P(k - 1) \\text{ are all true, then } P(k) \\text{ is true.}"}</MD>
        <p>
          Then <M>{"P(n)"}</M> is true for every <M>{"n \\ge a"}</M>. For <M>{"k = a"}</M> there are no earlier cases, so this
          includes proving <M>{"P(a)"}</M> outright. In practice, a few small cases are checked directly as base cases.

      <Theorem title="existence of prime factorisations">
        <p>Every integer <M>{"n \\ge 2"}</M> is a product of one or more primes.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let <M>{"n \\ge 2"}</M> and assume every integer m with <M>{"2 \\le m < n"}</M> is a product of primes. If n is prime,
          it is a product of one prime. Otherwise <M>{"n = ab"}</M> with <M>{"2 \\le a, b < n"}</M>. By the assumption, a and b
          are each products of primes, so their product n is too. By strong induction the claim holds for all{" "}
          <M>{"n \\ge 2"}</M>.

      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the stamps">
        <p>Every amount of at least ₹12 can be paid with ₹4 and ₹5 stamps.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <em>Base cases.</em> <M>{"12 = 4 + 4 + 4"}</M>, <M>{"13 = 4 + 4 + 5"}</M>, <M>{"14 = 4 + 5 + 5"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"15 = 5 + 5 + 5"}</M>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Step.</em> Let <M>{"k \\ge 16"}</M> and assume every amount from 12 to <M>{"k - 1"}</M> can be paid. Then{" "}
          <M>{"k - 4 \\ge 12"}</M> can be paid, and adding one ₹4 stamp pays k.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="a Fibonacci bound">
        <p>
          The Fibonacci numbers satisfy <M>{"F_1 = F_2 = 1"}</M> and <M>{"F_{k} = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}"}</M>. Claim:{" "}
          <M>{"F_n < 2^n"}</M> for all <M>{"n \\ge 1"}</M>. Both base cases hold. For <M>{"k \\ge 3"}</M>, assuming the claim for
          all smaller cases,
        </p>
        <MD>{"F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} < 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} < 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-1} = 2^k."}</MD>
        <p>The step uses two earlier cases, which is why strong induction, and two base cases, are needed.</p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="strong is not stronger">
        <p>
          Despite the name, strong induction proves nothing that ordinary induction cannot. Apply ordinary induction to the
          statement <M>{"Q(n)"}</M>: &ldquo;<M>{"P(a), \\dots, P(n)"}</M> are all true&rdquo;. The two principles are
          equivalent; strong induction is simply more convenient when a case depends on cases further back.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The next lesson looks at induction from the opposite end: instead of climbing up from the bottom, look at the smallest
      case where something goes wrong. The existence of prime factorisations proved here is half of the fundamental theorem of
      arithmetic; the other half, uniqueness, comes in Number Theory.
