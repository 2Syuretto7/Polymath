      <p>Prove: if <M>{"n^2"}</M> is even, then n is even.</p>
      <p>
        Try it directly. Assume <M>{"n^2"}</M> is even, so <M>{"n^2 = 2k"}</M> for some integer k. Then{" "}
        <M>{"n = \\sqrt{2k}"}</M>&hellip; and now what? There is no obvious way to show that <M>{"\\sqrt{2k}"}</M> is even, or
        even an integer. Where did the direct method go wrong, and is there a way round?

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The hypothesis &ldquo;<M>{"n^2"}</M> is even&rdquo; gives you information about <M>{"n^2"}</M>, but you want to
        conclude something about n, and square roots are hard to compute with. Turn the problem round. A conditional is
        equivalent to its contrapositive, so it is enough to prove: <em>if n is odd, then <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd</em>. Now
        the hypothesis is about n, which is easy to unpack, and the conclusion is about <M>{"n^2"}</M>, which is easy to
        compute.

      <p>
        Below, an n by n square is cut up to show why an odd n gives an odd <M>{"n^2"}</M>. Step through odd and even values
        of n.

      <Definition title="proof by contrapositive">
        <p>
          To prove <M>{"P \\to Q"}</M> by <strong>contrapositive</strong>, give a direct proof of{" "}
          <M>{"\\neg Q \\to \\neg P"}</M>: assume Q is false and deduce that P is false. This is valid because the two
          conditionals are logically equivalent, as you saw in the lesson on conditionals.

      <Theorem title="even squares">
        <p>For every integer n, if <M>{"n^2"}</M> is even, then n is even.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          We prove the contrapositive: if n is odd, then <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd. Let n be odd, so <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M> for
          some integer k. Then
        </p>
        <MD>{"n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1,"}</MD>
        <p>
          and <M>{"2k^2 + 2k"}</M> is an integer, so <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd. (Here &ldquo;not even&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd&rdquo;
          mean the same, since every integer is exactly one of the two.)
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="when to reach for it">
        <p>
          Try the contrapositive when the conclusion Q is a negative or awkward statement, or when its negation{" "}
          <M>{"\\neg Q"}</M> is easier to unpack than P. Statements of the form &ldquo;if <M>{"x^2"}</M>&hellip; then
          x&hellip;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;if a product&hellip; then a factor&hellip;&rdquo;, are typical. When you write it up,
          say at the start that you are proving the contrapositive and state it, so the reader knows the plan.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="a pigeonhole flavour">
        <p>
          Claim: if <M>{"x + y \\ge 100"}</M> for real numbers x and y, then <M>{"x \\ge 50"}</M> or <M>{"y \\ge 50"}</M>.
          The contrapositive is: if <M>{"x < 50"}</M> and <M>{"y < 50"}</M>, then <M>{"x + y < 100"}</M>. That is
          immediate, by adding the two inequalities. Notice how De Morgan&rsquo;s law turned the &ldquo;or&rdquo; into an
          &ldquo;and&rdquo;, which is much easier to use as a hypothesis.

      <Example title="a product with a factor">
        <p>
          Claim: for integers a and b, if ab is even then a is even or b is even. Contrapositive: if a and b are both odd,
          then ab is odd. With <M>{"a = 2j + 1"}</M> and <M>{"b = 2k + 1"}</M>,{" "}
          <M>{"ab = 4jk + 2j + 2k + 1 = 2(2jk + j + k) + 1"}</M>, which is odd.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The result of this lesson, that <M>{"n^2"}</M> even forces n even, is the key step in the most famous proof by

      its cases by remainder, is a first taste of modular arithmetic.
