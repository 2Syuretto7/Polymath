      <p>
        What is the largest number less than 1? Not 0.9, since 0.99 is larger; not 0.99, since 0.999 is larger. There is no
        largest one. Yet the numbers less than 1 plainly have a natural ceiling, namely 1 itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now stay inside the rationals, and look at the rationals whose square is less than 2. They too are bounded above: 2 is
        bigger than all of them, and so are 1.5 and 1.42. Is there a smallest rational that is bigger than all of them?
      </p>
    </>

  intuition: (

      <p>
        The rationals satisfy every axiom so far: they form an ordered field. Yet they have gaps. The rationals with square
        below 2 creep up towards a point where there is no rational to meet them. Calculus cannot live with gaps like this. A
        curve that starts below the axis and ends above it should cross the axis somewhere, and a sequence of better and better
        approximations should approach something.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third and last axiom fills the gaps. It says that whenever a set has a ceiling, it has a lowest possible ceiling.
        Below, choose a set and slide the candidate bound b. It turns from &ldquo;not an upper bound&rdquo; to &ldquo;upper
        bound&rdquo; at exactly one point.

      <Definition title="upper bounds and suprema">
        <p>
          Let S be a set of real numbers. A number b is an <strong>upper bound</strong> of S if <M>{"x \\le b"}</M> for every x
          in S, and S is <strong>bounded above</strong> if it has one. A number s is the <strong>supremum</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>least upper bound</strong>, of S, written <M>{"\\sup S"}</M>, if:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>s is an upper bound of S, and</li>
          <li>
            <M>{"s \\le b"}</M> for every upper bound b of S.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If the supremum belongs to S, it is the <strong>maximum</strong> of S. Lower bounds and the <strong>infimum</strong>,
          or greatest lower bound, <M>{"\\inf S"}</M>, are defined the same way with the inequalities reversed.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="suprema with and without maxima">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\sup\\,(0, 1] = 1"}</M>, and 1 is the maximum. <M>{"\\sup\\,(0, 1) = 1"}</M> too, but this set has no
          maximum. For <M>{"S = \\{1 - 1/n : n \\ge 1\\}"}</M>, every term is below 1, and any b below 1 is beaten by a term
          once <M>{"1/n < 1 - b"}</M>; so <M>{"\\sup S = 1"}</M>, and again it is not attained.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="the completeness axiom">
        <p>
          Every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a supremum in <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is our third and final axiom: <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> is a <strong>complete ordered field</strong>. One can
          prove that any two complete ordered fields are the same up to relabelling, so these axioms describe the real numbers
          exactly.

      </Definition>

      <Remark title="the rationals are not complete">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"S = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\\}"}</M>. It is non-empty and bounded above by 2. In{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> its supremum is <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M>. But <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M> is irrational, as you proved
          by contradiction in Proof and Logic, and between any rational upper bound and <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M> there is a smaller
          rational upper bound. So within <M>{"\\mathbb{Q}"}</M>, S has upper bounds but no least one.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Theorem title="the approximation property">
        <p>
          Let s be an upper bound of S. Then <M>{"s = \\sup S"}</M> if and only if, for every <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M>,
          there is an x in S with <M>{"x > s - \\varepsilon"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"s = \\sup S"}</M> and <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M>. Then <M>{"s - \\varepsilon < s"}</M>, so{" "}
          <M>{"s - \\varepsilon"}</M> is not an upper bound, since s is the least one. So some x in S has{" "}
          <M>{"x > s - \\varepsilon"}</M>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose the condition holds, and let b be any upper bound. If <M>{"b < s"}</M>, take{" "}
          <M>{"\\varepsilon = s - b > 0"}</M>: some x in S has <M>{"x > s - \\varepsilon = b"}</M>, contradicting that b is an
          upper bound. So <M>{"s \\le b"}</M>, and s is the least upper bound.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the Archimedean property">
        <p>
          The natural numbers are not bounded above in <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>. Equivalently, for every{" "}
          <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M> there is a natural number n with <M>{"1/n < \\varepsilon"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"\\mathbb{N}"}</M> were bounded above. By completeness it has a supremum s. By the approximation property
          with <M>{"\\varepsilon = 1"}</M>, there is a natural number n with <M>{"n > s - 1"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"n + 1 > s"}</M>, and <M>{"n + 1"}</M> is a natural number, so s is not an upper bound after all. For the second
          form, choose a natural number <M>{"n > 1/\\varepsilon"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why this is the axiom calculus needs">
        <p>
          The first two groups of axioms are algebra. Completeness is where analysis begins. Every major theorem of this course,
          that a continuous function crossing the axis has a root, that a bounded increasing sequence converges, that a
          continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum, rests on it, and each fails in <M>{"\\mathbb{Q}"}</M>. For
          example, <M>{"x^2 - 2"}</M> is negative at 1 and positive at 2, yet it has no rational root.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Completeness comes in many equivalent forms: every bounded monotone sequence converges, nested closed intervals have a
      common point, every Cauchy sequence converges. Real Analysis I proves they are all the same. Real Analysis II: Metric
      Spaces and Analysis in Rⁿ takes the Cauchy form and asks it of any space with a notion of distance.
