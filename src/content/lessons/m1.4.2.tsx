  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>Consider two sets of whole numbers:</p>
      <MD>{"A = \\{\\, n : n \\text{ is a multiple of } 6 \\,\\}, \\qquad B = \\{\\, n : n \\text{ is even and a multiple of } 3 \\,\\}."}</MD>
      <p>
        They are described differently. Are they the same set? How would you <em>prove</em> that two sets, each with
        infinitely many elements, are the same, when you cannot compare them element by element?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Break the question into two halves. Is every element of A in B? Is every element of B in A? If both answers are yes,
        nothing is in one but not the other, so they are the same set. Each half is a single &ldquo;for all&rdquo; statement,
        which you already know how to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare some sets of numbers from 1 to 12 below. Look for pairs where one sits inside the other, pairs that overlap,
        pairs with nothing in common, and two different descriptions of the same set.

      <Definition title="subset">
        <p>
          A is a <strong>subset</strong> of B, written <M>{"A \\subseteq B"}</M>, if every element of A is an element of B:
        </p>
        <MD>{"A \\subseteq B \\iff \\forall x\\, (x \\in A \\to x \\in B)."}</MD>
        <p>
          If also <M>{"A \\ne B"}</M>, A is a <strong>proper</strong> subset, written <M>{"A \\subsetneq B"}</M>. To show{" "}
          <M>{"A \\not\\subseteq B"}</M>, give one element of A that is not in B.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Definition title="equality of sets">
        <p>
          The <strong>axiom of extensionality</strong> says that sets with the same elements are equal. Equivalently,

        <MD>{"A = B \\iff A \\subseteq B \\text{ and } B \\subseteq A."}</MD>

      <Theorem title="the puzzle">
        <p>The multiples of 6 are exactly the integers that are even and multiples of 3.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          (<M>{"\\subseteq"}</M>) Let n be a multiple of 6, so <M>{"n = 6k"}</M>. Then <M>{"n = 2(3k)"}</M> is even and{" "}
          <M>{"n = 3(2k)"}</M> is a multiple of 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          (<M>{"\\supseteq"}</M>) Let n be even and a multiple of 3, so <M>{"n = 3m"}</M>. If m were odd, then 3m would be odd
          (a product of odd numbers), but n is even; so m is even, say <M>{"m = 2j"}</M>, and <M>{"n = 6j"}</M>.
        </p>
        <p>Both inclusions hold, so the sets are equal.</p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="∈ is not ⊆">
        <p>
          <M>{"x \\in A"}</M> says x is one of the things in A. <M>{"X \\subseteq A"}</M> says every thing in X is in A. So{" "}
          <M>{"1 \\in \\{1, 2\\}"}</M> and <M>{"\\{1\\} \\subseteq \\{1, 2\\}"}</M>, but <M>{"\\{1\\} \\notin \\{1, 2\\}"}</M>. In
          the box picture: an element is a thing in the box; a subset is a smaller box made from some of the things.

      <Theorem title="three basic facts">
        <p>For all sets A, B, C:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><M>{"A \\subseteq A"}</M>;</li>
          <li>if <M>{"A \\subseteq B"}</M> and <M>{"B \\subseteq C"}</M>, then <M>{"A \\subseteq C"}</M>;</li>
          <li><M>{"\\varnothing \\subseteq A"}</M>.</li>
        </ul>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          The first two follow directly from the definition. For the third, we must show{" "}
          <M>{"\\forall x\\,(x \\in \\varnothing \\to x \\in A)"}</M>. Since <M>{"x \\in \\varnothing"}</M> is always false, each
          instance of the conditional is true: the empty set is a subset of every set <em>vacuously</em>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="a set with no elements is unique">
        <p>
          If <M>{"E_1"}</M> and <M>{"E_2"}</M> both have no elements, then each is a subset of the other by the third fact, so{" "}
          <M>{"E_1 = E_2"}</M>. That is why we may speak of <em>the</em> empty set.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Next come the operations that build new sets from old: union, intersection, difference and complement. The subset
      relation is the first example of a partial order, studied later in this course. In Probability, events are subsets of
      the space of outcomes, and &ldquo;A implies B&rdquo; becomes <M>{"A \\subseteq B"}</M>.
