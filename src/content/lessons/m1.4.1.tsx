      <p>How many things are in each of these collections?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an empty bag;</li>
        <li>a bag containing one empty bag;</li>
        <li>a bag containing an empty bag and a bag that contains an empty bag.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The answers are 0, 1 and 2, but notice something strange: starting from nothing at all, just by putting bags inside
        bags, you have built collections with one and two members. Mathematicians take this idea astonishingly far. Almost
        every object in modern mathematics, numbers included, can be built in exactly this way.

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of things, considered as a single object. The things in it are its{" "}
        <strong>elements</strong>. A set is completely determined by which things are its elements: there is no order, no
        repetition, nothing else. A set can itself be an element of another set, just as a bag can sit inside another bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of a set as a box. Its elements are whatever sits <em>directly</em> inside, whether numbers or other boxes. Step
        through the examples below and count the elements of each.

      <Definition title="sets and membership">
        <p>
          We write <M>{"x \\in A"}</M> for &ldquo;x is an element of A&rdquo; and <M>{"x \\notin A"}</M> for &ldquo;x is not an
          element of A&rdquo;. A set can be given by <strong>listing</strong> its elements in braces, as{" "}
          <M>{"\\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}"}</M>, or in <strong>set-builder notation</strong>, as the elements of a domain satisfying a
          predicate:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\{\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N} : n \\text{ is prime and } n < 10 \\,\\} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}."}</MD>
        <p>The <strong>empty set</strong> <M>{"\\varnothing"}</M> has no elements at all.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><M>{"\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}"}</M>, the natural numbers (some books start at 1);</li>
          <li><M>{"\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}"}</M>, the integers, from German <em>Zahlen</em>, numbers;</li>
          <li><M>{"\\mathbb{Q}"}</M>, the rationals, fractions <M>{"p/q"}</M> with <M>{"q \\ne 0"}</M>, from <em>quotient</em>;</li>
          <li><M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>, the real numbers, every point on the number line.</li>

      <Remark title="order and repetition do not count">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\{1, 2, 3\\}"}</M>, <M>{"\\{3, 1, 2\\}"}</M> and <M>{"\\{1, 1, 2, 3\\}"}</M> are the same set, with three
          elements. A set records only <em>which</em> things belong, not how often or in what order. The number of elements
          of a finite set A is written <M>{"|A|"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="elements of elements">
        <p>
          In <M>{"A = \\{\\{1, 2\\}, 3\\}"}</M>, the elements are <M>{"\\{1, 2\\}"}</M> and 3, so <M>{"|A| = 2"}</M>. The
          number 1 is <em>not</em> an element of A: it is an element of an element. Membership does not pass down through
          boxes.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="numbers from nothing">
        <p>
          John von Neumann suggested in 1923 that each natural number be the set of all smaller ones:
        </p>
        <MD>{"0 = \\varnothing, \\quad 1 = \\{0\\} = \\{\\varnothing\\}, \\quad 2 = \\{0, 1\\} = \\{\\varnothing, \\{\\varnothing\\}\\}, \\quad 3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}, \\ \\dots"}</MD>
        <p>Then the number n is a set with exactly n elements, and the puzzle&rsquo;s three bags are 0, 1 and 2.</p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="a warning from Russell">
        <p>
          Can any predicate define a set? In 1901 Bertrand Russell considered <M>{"R = \\{\\, x : x \\notin x \\,\\}"}</M>, the
          set of all sets that are not elements of themselves. Is <M>{"R \\in R"}</M>? If it is, then by definition it is not;
          if it is not, then by definition it is. This paradox showed that unrestricted set-builder notation is contradictory.
          The cure, adopted in modern set theory, is to build sets only from elements of a set already given, as in{" "}
          <M>{"\\{x \\in D : P(x)\\}"}</M>.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Next comes the most important relation between sets, being a subset, and what it means for two sets to be equal. Russell
      found his way out of his paradox with the theory of types; modern mathematics uses the axioms of set theory instead,
      and the philosophy of mathematics asks what, if anything, sets really are.
