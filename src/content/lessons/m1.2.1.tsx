      <p>Is the sentence &ldquo;x is greater than 3&rdquo; true or false?</p>
      <p>
        Propositional logic insists that every statement is one or the other. Yet this sentence seems to be neither, and
        mathematics is full of sentences like it: &ldquo;n is prime&rdquo;, &ldquo;the triangle is right-angled&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;f is continuous&rdquo;. What kind of thing are they, and how do they become true or false?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        &ldquo;x is greater than 3&rdquo; is a statement with a hole in it. Fill the hole with 5 and you get a true statement;
        fill it with 2 and you get a false one. Such a sentence is a <strong>predicate</strong>. It behaves like a machine:
        feed it an object, and out comes a truth value.
      </p>
      <p>
        A predicate therefore sorts the objects it talks about into two piles: those that make it true and those that make it
        false. Pick a predicate below and watch it sort the numbers 1 to 20. Click any number to fill the hole with it.

      <Definition title="predicate, domain, truth set">
        <p>
          A <strong>predicate</strong> <M>{"P(x)"}</M> is a sentence containing a variable x that becomes a statement whenever
          x is replaced by an object from a fixed collection D, the <strong>domain</strong> (or domain of discourse). Its{" "}
          <strong>truth set</strong> is the collection of objects that make it true:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\{\\, x \\in D : P(x) \\,\\}."}</MD>
        <p>
          While x stands unreplaced it is a <strong>free variable</strong>, and <M>{"P(x)"}</M> has no truth value.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="the domain matters">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"P(x)"}</M> be &ldquo;<M>{"x^2 = 2"}</M>&rdquo;. Over the whole numbers its truth set is empty. Over the
          real numbers it is <M>{"\\{-\\sqrt 2, \\sqrt 2\\}"}</M>. The sentence is the same; the domain changes what it says.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="predicates of several variables">
        <p>
          A predicate may have more than one hole. &ldquo;<M>{"x < y"}</M>&rdquo; is a two-place predicate{" "}
          <M>{"R(x, y)"}</M>; it becomes a statement once both x and y are filled. &ldquo;x lies between y and z&rdquo; has
          three places. A two-place predicate is also called a <strong>relation</strong>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Proposition title="connectives act on truth sets">
        <p>Over a domain D, with truth sets <M>A</M> for P and <M>B</M> for Q:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><M>{"P(x) \\wedge Q(x)"}</M> has truth set the overlap of A and B (the elements in both);</li>
          <li><M>{"P(x) \\vee Q(x)"}</M> has truth set the combination of A and B (the elements in either);</li>
          <li><M>{"\\neg P(x)"}</M> has truth set the elements of D outside A.</li>
        </ul>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          An element d makes <M>{"P(d) \\wedge Q(d)"}</M> true exactly when it makes both true, that is, exactly when d is in
          both A and B. The other two cases are the same reasoning with &ldquo;either&rdquo; and &ldquo;not&rdquo;.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="a famous predicate">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"G(n)"}</M> be &ldquo;n is a sum of two primes&rdquo;. Then <M>{"G(28)"}</M> is true, as{" "}
          <M>{"28 = 5 + 23 = 11 + 17"}</M>, and <M>{"G(11)"}</M> is false (try it). Goldbach&rsquo;s conjecture of 1742
          says that every even number greater than 2 is in the truth set of G. Nobody has proved it, and nobody has found an
          even number that fails.

      <Remark title="Frege's insight">
        <p>
          In 1891, in &ldquo;Function and Concept&rdquo;, Gottlob Frege proposed that a predicate is literally a function, of
          the kind you met in school, whose outputs are always one of two values: the True and the False. This one idea,
          treating &ldquo;is prime&rdquo; like &ldquo;squared&rdquo;, made modern logic possible.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Filling the hole with a particular object is one way to turn a predicate into a statement. The next lesson shows the
      other, more powerful way: saying that the predicate holds for <em>every</em> object, or for <em>some</em>. Later in
      this course, truth sets become sets in their own right, and two-place predicates become relations.
