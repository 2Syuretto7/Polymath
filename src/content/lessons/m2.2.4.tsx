  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        A postal service charges by weight: up to 1 kg costs 40 rupees, and anything heavier, up to 2 kg, costs 60. As the
        weight of a parcel creeps up towards 1 kg, what does posting it cost? And as the weight comes down towards 1 kg from
        above?
      </p>
      <p>
        A second question. What happens to <M>{"1/x"}</M> as x approaches 0? Is &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; an answer?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The postage approaches 40 from one side and 60 from the other. There is no single limit at 1 kg, but there are two
        perfectly good <strong>one-sided</strong> limits. Many functions defined piece by piece behave like this, and so do
        functions like <M>{"\\sqrt{x}"}</M> that only make sense on one side of a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for <M>{"1/x"}</M>, its values near 0 grow beyond every bound. That is not a limit in the sense of the last two
        lessons, since no number L fits. But it is a very definite kind of behaviour, and we describe it by writing{" "}
        <M>{"\\infty"}</M>. Explore the four functions below.

      <Definition title="one-sided limits">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L"}</M>, the limit from the right, means: for every <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M> there
          is a <M>{"\\delta > 0"}</M> such that <M>{"a < x < a + \\delta"}</M> implies <M>{"|f(x) - L| < \\varepsilon"}</M>.
          The limit from the left, <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x)"}</M>, is the same with <M>{"a - \\delta < x < a"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="two sides make a limit">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L"}</M> if and only if both one-sided limits exist and equal L.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        One direction is immediate: the two-sided condition includes both one-sided ones. For the other, take the smaller of
        the two deltas.
      </p>

      <Example title="a jump">
        <p>
          For <M>{"f(x) = x/|x|"}</M>, every x &gt; 0 gives 1 and every x &lt; 0 gives <M>{"-1"}</M>. So{" "}
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = 1"}</M> and <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = -1"}</M>. They differ, so{" "}
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x)"}</M> does not exist. The postage function has a jump of the same kind at 1 kg.

      <Definition title="infinite limits">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = \\infty"}</M> means: for every number B there is a <M>{"\\delta > 0"}</M> such that{" "}
          <M>{"0 < |x - a| < \\delta"}</M> implies <M>{"f(x) > B"}</M>. Similarly for <M>{"-\\infty"}</M> (with{" "}
          <M>{"f(x) < B"}</M>) and for one-sided versions. The line <M>{"x = a"}</M> is then a{" "}
          <strong>vertical asymptote</strong> of the graph.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="infinity is not a number">
        <p>
          Writing <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0} 1/x^2 = \\infty"}</M> does not say the limit exists and equals a number called{" "}
          <M>{"\\infty"}</M>. It says, precisely, that the limit does not exist, and fails to in a particular way. The field
          axioms contain no <M>{"\\infty"}</M>, and the limit laws do not apply to it: <M>{"\\infty - \\infty"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"\\infty/\\infty"}</M> have no meaning.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="from both sides">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} 1/x = \\infty"}</M> and <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0^-} 1/x = -\\infty"}</M>: given B &gt; 0, take{" "}
          <M>{"\\delta = 1/B"}</M>, and then <M>{"0 < x < \\delta"}</M> gives <M>{"1/x > B"}</M>. Since the two sides
          disagree, we cannot write anything for the two-sided limit of <M>{"1/x"}</M>. For <M>{"1/x^2"}</M>, both sides go to{" "}
          <M>{"\\infty"}</M>, so <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to 0} 1/x^2 = \\infty"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="limits at infinity">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L"}</M> means: for every <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M> there is a number N such
          that <M>{"x > N"}</M> implies <M>{"|f(x) - L| < \\varepsilon"}</M>. The line <M>{"y = L"}</M> is then a{" "}
          <strong>horizontal asymptote</strong>. The limit laws hold for limits at infinity too.

      <Example title="rational functions at infinity">
        <p>Divide top and bottom by the highest power of x on the bottom:</p>
        <MD>{"\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3x^2 + 1}{2x^2 - x} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{3 + 1/x^2}{2 - 1/x} = \\frac{3}{2},"}</MD>
