  puzzle: (

      <p>
        Draw the number line and mark every rational number on it: every fraction, positive and negative. Between any
        two of them there is another, so the marks are packed together with no two neighbours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you covered the whole line? If you drew a circle of radius <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M> centred at 0, would it cross
        the line at a mark?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        It would not. The circle crosses the line at <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M>, and the last lesson proved that is not a
        fraction. So the rationals, packed as they are, leave holes, and the holes are everywhere: at{" "}
        <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M>, at <M>{"\\sqrt{2} + 1"}</M>, at <M>{"\\tfrac{\\sqrt 2}{2}"}</M>, and at infinitely many other
        points in every stretch of the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can trap <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M> with fractions as tightly as you like. It lies between 1 and 2, then between 1.4
        and 1.5, then between 1.41 and 1.42, and so on. Each interval sits inside the last and is ten times shorter. Try
        it below.
      </p>
      <NestedIntervalsViz />
      <p>
        The intervals close in on a single point, yet no fraction is at that point. The <strong>real numbers</strong> are
        what you get when you fill every such hole: one number for every point of the line.

      <Definition title="the real numbers">
        <p>
          The <strong>real numbers</strong> <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> are the numbers that measure positions on a line,
          equivalently the numbers with a decimal expansion, finite or infinite. They include the integers, the
          rationals and the irrationals:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R}."}</MD>
        <p>
          The laws of arithmetic and the facts about order from the earlier lessons all hold in <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>.
          What is new is one further property.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Axiom title="completeness, nested interval form">
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"[a_1, b_1] \\supseteq [a_2, b_2] \\supseteq [a_3, b_3] \\supseteq \\cdots"}</M> are closed
          intervals, each inside the one before, and their lengths <M>{"b_n - a_n"}</M> become smaller than any positive
          number you choose. Then there is exactly one real number that lies in every one of them.
        </p>
      </Axiom>

      <p>
        The rationals fail this test: the decimal intervals around <M>{"\\sqrt{2}"}</M> have rational endpoints, but no
        rational number lies in all of them. Completeness is precisely the statement &ldquo;the line has no holes&rdquo;.
        Calculus depends on it at every turn, and in Real Analysis you will build <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> from{" "}
        <M>{"\\mathbb{Q}"}</M> and prove it, rather than assume it.

      <Definition title="intervals">
        <p>For real numbers <M>{"a < b"}</M>:</p>

          <li><M>{"[a, \\infty)"}</M> is all <M>{"x \\ge a"}</M>, and <M>{"(-\\infty, b)"}</M> is all <M>{"x < b"}</M>. The symbol <M>{"\\infty"}</M> is not a number; it only says the interval goes on for ever.</li>

        <p>
          So <M>{"|x|"}</M> is the distance from <M>x</M> to 0, and <M>{"|x - y|"}</M> is the distance between <M>x</M>{" "}

      <Proposition title="distance and intervals">
        <p>For <M>{"r > 0"}</M>: <M>{"|x - a| < r"}</M> exactly when <M>{"a - r < x < a + r"}</M>.</p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          If <M>{"x \\ge a"}</M>, then <M>{"|x - a| = x - a"}</M>, and <M>{"x - a < r"}</M> means <M>{"x < a + r"}</M>; the
          other inequality <M>{"a - r < x"}</M> holds automatically since <M>{"a - r < a \\le x"}</M>. If{" "}
          <M>{"x < a"}</M>, then <M>{"|x - a| = a - x"}</M>, and <M>{"a - x < r"}</M> means <M>{"x > a - r"}</M>, while{" "}
          <M>{"x < a < a + r"}</M> holds automatically. In both cases the two statements say the same thing.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>In words: the points within distance <M>r</M> of <M>a</M> form the open interval centred at <M>a</M> of radius <M>r</M>.</p>

      <Example>
        <p>
          Solve <M>{"|2x - 3| \\le 5"}</M>. The same argument with <M>{"\\le"}</M> gives <M>{"-5 \\le 2x - 3 \\le 5"}</M>.
          Add 3: <M>{"-2 \\le 2x \\le 8"}</M>. Divide by 2: <M>{"-1 \\le x \\le 4"}</M>. The solution set is{" "}
          <M>{"[-1, 4]"}</M>.

      </Example>

      <Theorem title="the triangle inequality">
        <p>For all real <M>x</M> and <M>y</M>, <M>{"|x + y| \\le |x| + |y|"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Add the inequalities <M>{"-|x| \\le x \\le |x|"}</M> and <M>{"-|y| \\le y \\le |y|"}</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"-(|x| + |y|) \\le x + y \\le |x| + |y|."}</MD>
        <p>
          By the proposition (in its <M>{"\\le"}</M> form, with <M>{"a = 0"}</M> and <M>{"r = |x| + |y|"}</M>), this says{" "}
          <M>{"|x + y| \\le |x| + |y|"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why the name">
        <p>
          Put <M>{"x = p - q"}</M> and <M>{"y = q - s"}</M>. The theorem becomes{" "}
          <M>{"|p - s| \\le |p - q| + |q - s|"}</M>: going from <M>p</M> to <M>s</M> directly is never longer than going
          by way of <M>q</M>. In the plane, that is the statement that one side of a triangle is no longer than the other
          two together. This inequality will be your most-used tool in Calculus and Real Analysis.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Theorem title="rationals are everywhere">
        <p>Between any two different real numbers there is a rational number.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Let <M>{"x < y"}</M>, and choose <M>k</M> so large that <M>{"10^{-k} < y - x"}</M>. Walk along the line in steps of <M>{"10^{-k}"}</M>, that is, through the
          numbers <M>{"\\tfrac{m}{10^k}"}</M> for integers <M>m</M>, and let <M>q</M> be the first of them that is greater than{" "}
          <M>x</M>. Then <M>q</M> is rational, and since the step before it was at most <M>x</M>, we have{" "}
          <M>{"x < q \\le x + 10^{-k} < y"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        So both kinds of number are spread through the whole line: rationals between any two reals, and, as an exercise
        in Calculus will show, irrationals too. Yet in a precise sense you will meet in Proof and Logic, there are far
        more irrationals than rationals.

      This completes the number systems of school mathematics, from counting to the continuum. Completeness returns as
      the least upper bound property in Calculus, and in Real Analysis you will build the reals from the rationals. The
      statement <M>{"|x - a| < r"}</M> is the seed of the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. Next, letters stand in for
      numbers, and algebra begins.
