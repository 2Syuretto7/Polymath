      <p>
        A rectangular garden is growing. Its length is 4 m and increasing at 1 m per year; its width is 2.5 m and increasing
        at 0.8 m per year. How fast is its area growing right now?
      </p>
      <p>
        A tempting answer is the product of the rates, <M>{"1 \\times 0.8 = 0.8"}</M> square metres per year. Try it with a
        rectangle that is not growing in width at all. Does the tempting answer still make sense?

  intuition: (

      <p>
        Working every derivative out from the definition would be slow. Instead, we prove a few rules once, for sums,
        products and quotients, and then differentiate any formula built from simple pieces. The product rule is the
        surprising one. The derivative of a product is not the product of the derivatives, as the garden shows: if the width
        stays fixed, the area still grows, because the length does.

      <Theorem title="sums and constant multiples">
        <p>
          If f and g are differentiable at x and c is a constant, then <M>{"(f + g)' = f' + g'"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"(cf)' = cf'"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <p>These follow at once from the limit laws applied to the difference quotients.</p>

      <Theorem title="the power rule">
        <p>
          For every whole number <M>{"n \\ge 1"}</M>, <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>By the binomial theorem,</p>
        <MD>{"(x + h)^n = x^n + n x^{n-1} h + \\binom{n}{2} x^{n-2} h^2 + \\cdots + h^n."}</MD>
        <p>
          Subtract <M>{"x^n"}</M> and divide by h: the result is <M>{"n x^{n-1}"}</M> plus terms each containing a factor of h,
          which tend to 0.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the product rule">
        <p>
          If f and g are differentiable at x, so is fg, and <M>{"(fg)' = f'g + fg'"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Add and subtract <M>{"f(x + h) g(x)"}</M> in the numerator, which is the picture&rsquo;s split into two strips:</p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x)}{h} = f(x + h)\\,\\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} + g(x)\\,\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}."}</MD>
        <p>
          As <M>{"h \\to 0"}</M>, <M>{"f(x + h) \\to f(x)"}</M> because differentiable functions are continuous, and the two
          quotients tend to <M>{"g'(x)"}</M> and <M>{"f'(x)"}</M>. The corner in the picture is hidden in the difference
          between <M>{"f(x + h)"}</M> and <M>{"f(x)"}</M>, and it disappears in the limit.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the quotient rule">
        <p>
          If f and g are differentiable at x and <M>{"g(x) \\ne 0"}</M>, then
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <p>
        First show <M>{"(1/g)' = -g'/g^2"}</M> from the definition, as for <M>{"1/x"}</M> in the last lesson, then apply the
        product rule to <M>{"f \\cdot (1/g)"}</M>. With it, the power rule extends to negative powers:{" "}
        <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx} x^{-n} = -n x^{-n-1}"}</M>.
      </p>

      <Theorem title="sine and cosine">
        <p>
          With x in radians, <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx} \\sin x = \\cos x"}</M> and <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx} \\cos x = -\\sin x"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>By the addition formula,</p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{\\sin(x + h) - \\sin x}{h} = \\sin x \\cdot \\frac{\\cos h - 1}{h} + \\cos x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin h}{h}."}</MD>
        <p>
          We know <M>{"\\sin h / h \\to 1"}</M>. And{" "}
          <M>{"\\dfrac{\\cos h - 1}{h} = -\\dfrac{\\sin^2 h}{h(\\cos h + 1)} = -\\dfrac{\\sin h}{h} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\sin h}{\\cos h + 1} \\to -1 \\cdot 0 = 0"}</M>.
          So the quotient tends to <M>{"\\cos x"}</M>. Cosine is similar.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why radians">
        <p>
          The limit <M>{"\\sin h / h \\to 1"}</M> holds only when angles are measured in radians. In degrees, the derivative of{" "}
          <M>{"\\sin x"}</M> would be <M>{"\\tfrac{\\pi}{180} \\cos x"}</M>. Radians are the units in which calculus is simple,
          which is why mathematicians use them.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="putting the rules together">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(3x^4 - 5x + 2\\right) = 12x^3 - 5"}</M>. <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2 \\sin x) = 2x \\sin x + x^2 \\cos x"}</M>.
          And
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{d}{dx} \\tan x = \\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\frac{\\cos x \\cos x - \\sin x(-\\sin x)}{\\cos^2 x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2 x}."}</MD>

      <Remark title="the garden">
        <p>
          With length 4 growing at 1, and width 2.5 growing at 0.8, the area grows at{" "}
          <M>{"1 \\times 2.5 + 4 \\times 0.8 = 5.7"}</M> square metres per year, not 0.8. The exponential function, which is its

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Every rule here runs backwards later in the course: the product rule becomes integration by parts. And the one function
      missing from this lesson, the exponential, will turn out to be defined by the property that it is its own derivative.
