  puzzle: (

      <p>
        Six people meet at a party. Some pairs already know each other; the rest are strangers. Show that there must be three
        people who all know each other, or three people who are all strangers to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <M>{"2^{15} = 32768"}</M> ways the acquaintances could be arranged, far too many to check one by one. Yet a
        short argument settles every one of them. Before reading on, focus on a single guest and ask how many of the other
        five she knows.
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Pick a guest, Anu. Of the other five, either at least three know Anu, or at least three are strangers to her, since
        five cannot split as two and two. That is the first split into cases. In the first case, look at three people who
        know Anu. If any two of them know each other, those two and Anu are three mutual acquaintances. If no two of them do,
        they are three mutual strangers. Either way, done. The second case is the same with the roles swapped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every arrangement falls into one case or the other, and each case was handled. That is a{" "}
        <strong>proof by cases</strong>. With numbers, the most common split is by remainder: every integer leaves one of
        just a few remainders when divided by m. Explore below.

      <Definition title="proof by cases">
        <p>
          To prove Q, find statements <M>{"P_1, \\dots, P_k"}</M> such that at least one of them must hold, and prove{" "}
          <M>{"P_i \\to Q"}</M> for each i. This is valid because
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\big((P_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee P_k) \\wedge (P_1 \\to Q) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge (P_k \\to Q)\\big) \\to Q"}</MD>
        <p>
          is a tautology. The cases must be <strong>exhaustive</strong>: together they must cover every possibility. They need
          not be exclusive, though it is tidier when they are.

      <Theorem title="n² + n is even">
        <p>For every integer n, <M>{"n^2 + n"}</M> is even.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Every integer is even or odd.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Case 1: n is even</em>, say <M>{"n = 2k"}</M>. Then <M>{"n^2 + n = 4k^2 + 2k = 2(2k^2 + k)"}</M>, which is even.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Case 2: n is odd</em>, say <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"n^2 + n = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 2k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1)"}</M>, which is even.
        </p>
        <p>In both cases <M>{"n^2 + n"}</M> is even.</p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="squares modulo 4">
        <p>Every perfect square leaves remainder 0 or 1 on division by 4.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          If n is even, <M>{"n = 2k"}</M> and <M>{"n^2 = 4k^2"}</M>, remainder 0. If n is odd,{" "}
          <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M> and <M>{"n^2 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1"}</M>, remainder 1.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        So no number of the form <M>{"4q + 3"}</M>, such as 4003, is a perfect square, and a sum of two squares leaves
        remainder 0, 1 or 2, never 3. A few lines of cases rule out infinitely many numbers.
      </p>

      <Example title="absolute value">
        <p>
          Statements about <M>{"|x|"}</M> are natural candidates, since <M>{"|x|"}</M> is defined by cases: <M>{"|x| = x"}</M>{" "}
          if <M>{"x \\ge 0"}</M> and <M>{"|x| = -x"}</M> if <M>{"x < 0"}</M>. To prove <M>{"|xy| = |x|\\,|y|"}</M>, split by the
          signs of x and y: four cases, each a line of algebra.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="without loss of generality">
        <p>
          In the party proof the second case was the first with &ldquo;know&rdquo; and &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; swapped.
          Mathematicians write &ldquo;<strong>without loss of generality</strong>, at least three know Anu&rdquo;, meaning
          that the other case is the same argument with the names changed. Use the phrase only when that is truly so, and it
          is good manners to say why.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Splitting by remainders is the start of modular arithmetic, which Discrete Mathematics and Elementary Number Theory
      build into a powerful tool. The party puzzle is the smallest case of Ramsey&rsquo;s theorem, which says that complete
      disorder is impossible in any large enough structure. Next comes proving that something exists, and that it is the only
      one.
