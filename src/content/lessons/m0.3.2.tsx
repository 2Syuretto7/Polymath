  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        A train leaves a station and you plot its distance from the station against time. Could part of that graph be a
        vertical line segment? Could part of it be horizontal? Could the graph ever bend back on itself, like the letter
        S lying on its side?
      </p>
      <p>Each answer says something about trains, and something about functions.</p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        A horizontal piece is fine: the train is standing still, the same distance at many times. A vertical piece is
        impossible: at one instant the train would be at many distances at once. A sideways S is impossible for the same
        reason. The rule &ldquo;at each time, exactly one distance&rdquo; is the definition of a function, and on a graph it
        becomes something you can see: <em>no vertical line meets the graph more than once</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slide the vertical line across each curve below. The circle and the sideways parabola are perfectly good curves,
        but they are not graphs of functions of <M>x</M>.

      <Definition title="graph">
        <p>The <strong>graph</strong> of a function <M>f</M> with domain <M>D</M> is the set of points</p>
        <MD>{"\\{\\, (x, y) : x \\in D \\text{ and } y = f(x) \\,\\}."}</MD>
        <p>
          A point <M>{"(p, q)"}</M> lies on the graph exactly when <M>p</M> is in the domain and{" "}
          <M>{"q = f(p)"}</M>. The equation <M>{"y = f(x)"}</M> is a test that each point passes or fails.

      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="the vertical line test">
        <p>
          A set <M>S</M> of points in the plane is the graph of a function of <M>x</M> exactly when every vertical line
          meets <M>S</M> at most once. The domain of that function is the set of <M>c</M> for which the line{" "}
          <M>{"x = c"}</M> meets <M>S</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          If <M>S</M> is the graph of <M>f</M> and the line <M>{"x = c"}</M> met it at <M>{"(c, q_1)"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"(c, q_2)"}</M>, then <M>{"q_1 = f(c) = q_2"}</M>, so the two points are the same. Conversely, suppose each
          vertical line meets <M>S</M> at most once. Let <M>D</M> be the set of <M>c</M> whose line meets <M>S</M>, and for
          such <M>c</M> let <M>{"f(c)"}</M> be the height of the one meeting point. Then <M>f</M> gives each <M>c</M> in{" "}
          <M>D</M> exactly one value, and its graph is <M>S</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <p>Reading a graph means translating between its geometry and the function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>y-intercept</strong> is <M>{"(0, f(0))"}</M>; the <strong>x-intercepts</strong> are the roots, where <M>{"f(x) = 0"}</M>.</li>
        <li>The solutions of <M>{"f(x) = k"}</M> are where the graph meets the horizontal line <M>{"y = k"}</M>.</li>
        <li>The solutions of <M>{"f(x) = g(x)"}</M> are the <M>x</M>-coordinates where the two graphs cross.</li>
        <li>
          <M>f</M> is <strong>increasing</strong> on an interval if <M>{"a < b"}</M> implies <M>{"f(a) < f(b)"}</M> there:
          the graph rises from left to right. <strong>Decreasing</strong> is the reverse.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Example title="solving by picture, then by algebra">
        <p>
          How many solutions does <M>{"x^2 = x + 2"}</M> have? Sketch the parabola <M>{"y = x^2"}</M> and the line{" "}
          <M>{"y = x + 2"}</M>: the line crosses the parabola twice, once on each side of the axis. Algebra confirms it:{" "}
          <M>{"x^2 - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1)"}</M>, so <M>{"x = 2"}</M> or <M>{"x = -1"}</M>, at the points{" "}
          <M>{"(2, 4)"}</M> and <M>{"(-1, 1)"}</M>. The picture tells you what to expect; the algebra makes it exact.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Definition title="even and odd functions">
        <p>
          A function is <strong>even</strong> if <M>{"f(-x) = f(x)"}</M> for every <M>x</M> in its domain, and{" "}
          <strong>odd</strong> if <M>{"f(-x) = -f(x)"}</M>. (The domain must contain <M>{"-x"}</M> whenever it contains{" "}
          <M>x</M>.) <M>{"x^2"}</M>, <M>{"x^4"}</M> and <M>{"|x|"}</M> are even; <M>x</M>, <M>{"x^3"}</M> and{" "}
          <M>{"\\tfrac1x"}</M> are odd; <M>{"x^2 + x"}</M> is neither.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Proposition title="symmetry">
        <p>
          The graph of an even function is symmetric in the <M>y</M>-axis. The graph of an odd function is symmetric about
          the origin: turning it through half a turn about <M>{"(0, 0)"}</M> leaves it unchanged.
        </p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Reflection in the <M>y</M>-axis sends <M>{"(x, y)"}</M> to <M>{"(-x, y)"}</M>. If <M>f</M> is even and{" "}
          <M>{"(x, y)"}</M> is on the graph, then <M>{"y = f(x) = f(-x)"}</M>, so <M>{"(-x, y)"}</M> is on the graph too.
          A half turn about the origin sends <M>{"(x, y)"}</M> to <M>{"(-x, -y)"}</M>. If <M>f</M> is odd and{" "}
          <M>{"y = f(x)"}</M>, then <M>{"f(-x) = -f(x) = -y"}</M>, so <M>{"(-x, -y)"}</M> is on the graph.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="what a graph cannot show">
        <p>
          A drawn graph shows a window of the plane at finite resolution. It cannot show what happens far outside the
          window, it hides very small wiggles, and it cannot distinguish 1.9999 from 2. Treat a graph as evidence and a
          guide, and confirm what it suggests by algebra, as in the example above. Calculus is, in part, the toolkit for
          finding out exactly what a graph only hints at: where it turns, how steeply it climbs, and whether it has gaps.

      Next, the two families of graphs you will meet most: straight lines and parabolas. The Cartesian plane and conic
      sections return in the chapter on coordinates and vectors, where curves like the circle are described by equations
      that are not functions. In Calculus, continuity makes precise the idea of a graph with no gaps, and the derivative
      measures how steeply a graph climbs.
