      <p>
        A farmer has 40 metres of fencing and wants a rectangular pen against a long straight wall, so only three sides
        need fencing. What shape gives the largest area?
      </p>
      <p>
        Try a few: sides of 5 and 30 give 150 square metres; 15 and 10 give 150 again. Somewhere in between is better. Where
        exactly, and how can you be sure nothing beats it?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Let each side touching the wall be <M>x</M> metres. The side parallel to the wall uses what is left,{" "}
        <M>{"40 - 2x"}</M>, so the area is <M>{"A(x) = x(40 - 2x)"}</M>. That is a quadratic, and its graph is a parabola
        opening downwards. The largest area is at the top of the parabola, its <strong>vertex</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parabolas are symmetric, and the two trials that gave 150, at <M>{"x = 5"}</M> and <M>{"x = 15"}</M>, sit at the
        same height, so the vertex is halfway between them, at <M>{"x = 10"}</M>: a pen 10 by 20, area 200. To make such
        arguments routine, we need to understand the two simplest families of functions. Lines change at a constant rate;
        parabolas are lines&rsquo; first departure from constancy. Explore both.

      <Definition title="linear function and slope">
        <p>
          A <strong>linear function</strong> has the form <M>{"f(x) = mx + c"}</M>. Its graph is a straight line with{" "}
          <strong>slope</strong> (or gradient) <M>m</M> and <M>y</M>-intercept <M>{"(0, c)"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Proposition title="constant rate of change">
        <p>
          For a linear function <M>{"f(x) = mx + c"}</M> and any two inputs <M>{"x_1 \\neq x_2"}</M>,
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = m."}</MD>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"f(x_2) - f(x_1) = (mx_2 + c) - (mx_1 + c) = m(x_2 - x_1)"}</M>. Divide by <M>{"x_2 - x_1"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        So the slope is &ldquo;rise over run&rdquo; between <em>any</em> two points, and that is what makes the graph
        straight. It also gives the line through a point <M>{"(x_1, y_1)"}</M> with slope <M>m</M>:{" "}
        <M>{"y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)"}</M>. Lines with the same slope are parallel. Two lines with slopes{" "}
        <M>{"m_1, m_2"}</M>, neither vertical, are perpendicular exactly when <M>{"m_1 m_2 = -1"}</M>: turning a slope
        triangle with run 1 and rise <M>m</M> through a right angle gives run <M>{"-m"}</M> and rise 1, so slope{" "}
        <M>{"-\\tfrac{1}{m}"}</M>.

      <Definition title="quadratic function">
        <p>
          A <strong>quadratic function</strong> has the form <M>{"f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c"}</M> with <M>{"a \\neq 0"}</M>. Its
          graph is a <strong>parabola</strong>, opening upwards when <M>{"a > 0"}</M> and downwards when{" "}
          <M>{"a < 0"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="vertex form">
        <p>Every quadratic can be written as</p>
        <MD>{"ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - h)^2 + k, \\quad \\text{where } h = -\\frac{b}{2a}, \\ k = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}."}</MD>
        <p>
          If <M>{"a > 0"}</M> the least value of <M>f</M> is <M>k</M>, taken only at <M>{"x = h"}</M>; if{" "}
          <M>{"a < 0"}</M>, <M>k</M> is the greatest value. The graph is symmetric in the vertical line <M>{"x = h"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Complete the square, as in the proof of the quadratic formula:</p>
        <MD>{"a\\left(x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x\\right) + c = a\\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4a} + c."}</MD>
        <p>
          Suppose <M>{"a > 0"}</M>. The square <M>{"(x - h)^2"}</M> is never negative and is zero only at{" "}
          <M>{"x = h"}</M>, so <M>{"f(x) \\ge k"}</M> with equality only there. For <M>{"a < 0"}</M> the inequality
          reverses. Finally <M>{"f(h + t) = at^2 + k = f(h - t)"}</M> for every <M>t</M>, which is the symmetry.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="the puzzle, proved">
        <p>
          <M>{"A(x) = 40x - 2x^2 = -2(x^2 - 20x) = -2(x - 10)^2 + 200"}</M>. Since <M>{"-2(x - 10)^2 \\le 0"}</M>, the area
          is at most 200, and it equals 200 only when <M>{"x = 10"}</M>. No guessing, and no pen can do better.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="three forms, three uses">
        <p>
          The same quadratic can be written in standard form <M>{"ax^2 + bx + c"}</M>, which shows the{" "}
          <M>y</M>-intercept <M>c</M>; in vertex form <M>{"a(x - h)^2 + k"}</M>, which shows the turning point; and, when
          it has real roots, in factored form <M>{"a(x - r)(x - s)"}</M>, which shows where it crosses the axis. The axis of
          symmetry sits midway between the roots: <M>{"h = \\tfrac{r + s}{2}"}</M>, the trick used in the puzzle. Choosing
          the right form for the question is half the work.

      Next, building new functions from old ones: doing one function after another, and undoing a function. Lines return
      with conic sections in the chapter on the plane, and arithmetic sequences are linear functions on the whole numbers.
      In Calculus, the slope of a line becomes the derivative, the slope of a curve at a point, and the vertex is where that
      slope is zero. In Linear Algebra, &ldquo;linear&rdquo; acquires a stricter meaning: <M>{"mx + c"}</M> with{" "}
      <M>{"c \\neq 0"}</M> no longer qualifies.
