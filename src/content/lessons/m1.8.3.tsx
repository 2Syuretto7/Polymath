      <p>
        The hotel of the last lesson could take in any countable crowd. So try to list every infinite sequence of zeros and
        ones, such as <M>{"0101010\\ldots"}</M> or <M>{"1101000\\ldots"}</M>, one per room. Infinitely many rooms; surely
        enough?
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose someone hands you a list and claims it is complete. Can you, without checking the rooms one by one forever,
        prove that some sequence is missing?

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Georg Cantor found a way in 1891. Build a new sequence d one digit at a time: make its first digit differ from the
        first digit of the first sequence, its second digit differ from the second digit of the second sequence, and so on
        down the diagonal. Then d differs from every sequence in the list somewhere, so it is not in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to defeat the argument below. Change any digits you like; d changes with them and still escapes.

      <Definition title="uncountable">
        <p>A set is <strong>uncountable</strong> if it is not countable.</p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="Cantor, 1891">
        <p>The set <M>{"\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}"}</M> of all infinite sequences of zeros and ones is uncountable.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          It is infinite, so suppose for contradiction that <M>{"s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots"}</M> lists it, and write{" "}
          <M>{"s_i(j)"}</M> for the j-th digit of <M>{"s_i"}</M>. Define a sequence d by
        </p>
        <MD>{"d(j) = 1 - s_j(j)."}</MD>
        <p>
          Then d is a sequence of zeros and ones, so <M>{"d = s_k"}</M> for some k. But{" "}
          <M>{"d(k) = 1 - s_k(k) \\ne s_k(k)"}</M>, a contradiction.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the real numbers are uncountable">
        <p>The interval <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M>, and hence <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>, is uncountable.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Send each sequence s of zeros and ones to the real number with decimal digits{" "}
          <M>{"0.d_0 d_1 d_2 \\ldots"}</M>, where <M>{"d_j = 5"}</M> if <M>{"s(j) = 0"}</M> and <M>{"d_j = 6"}</M> if{" "}
          <M>{"s(j) = 1"}</M>. Decimals using only the digits 5 and 6 have no second decimal form (the trouble with{" "}
          <M>{"0.1999\\ldots = 0.2"}</M> needs a 9 or a 0), so different sequences give different numbers: this is an injection
          into <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M>. If <M>{"(0, 1)"}</M> were countable, its subset, the image of this injection, would be
          countable, and so would the set of sequences. That contradicts Cantor&rsquo;s theorem.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="Cantor's theorem">
        <p>For every set A, there is no surjection <M>{"f : A \\to \\mathcal{P}(A)"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Given any <M>{"f : A \\to \\mathcal{P}(A)"}</M>, let</p>
        <MD>{"D = \\{\\, a \\in A : a \\notin f(a) \\,\\}."}</MD>
        <p>
          If <M>{"D = f(k)"}</M> for some k, then <M>{"k \\in D"}</M> if and only if <M>{"k \\notin f(k) = D"}</M>, which is
          impossible. So D is not in the image of f.
        </p>
      </Proof>
      <p>
        This is the diagonal argument again: membership of a in <M>{"f(a)"}</M> plays the role of the diagonal digit. So every
        set has strictly more subsets than elements, and the sizes of infinite sets climb without end:{" "}
        <M>{"\\mathbb{N}"}</M>, <M>{"\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})"}</M>, <M>{"\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))"}</M>, &hellip;
      </p>

      <Example title="transcendental numbers exist">
        <p>
          A real number is <strong>algebraic</strong> if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. There
          are countably many such polynomials, each with finitely many roots, so the algebraic numbers are countable. Since{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> is not, some real numbers are not algebraic: they are <strong>transcendental</strong>. Cantor
          gave this argument in 1874, proving that transcendental numbers exist, indeed that all but countably many reals are
          transcendental, without exhibiting a single one.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="diagonals everywhere">
        <p>
          The set D in Cantor&rsquo;s theorem is a close relative of Russell&rsquo;s paradoxical set of all sets that are not
          members of themselves. The same self-referential twist proves that no program can decide whether every program halts,
          and lies at the heart of Gödel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems. Some mathematicians of Cantor&rsquo;s day, notably
          Leopold Kronecker, rejected his work; David Hilbert later declared that no one would expel mathematics from the
          paradise Cantor had created.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      So some infinite sets are larger than others. But how do we compare two infinite sets when we cannot build a bijection
      directly? The last lesson of the course gives the tool. The diagonal argument returns in the halting problem and in
      Gödel&rsquo;s theorems, and Russell&rsquo;s paradox in the Philosophy of Mathematics.
