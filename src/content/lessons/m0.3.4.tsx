      <p>
        To turn degrees Celsius into Fahrenheit, multiply by <M>{"\\tfrac95"}</M> and then add 32. A friend says that to
        turn Fahrenheit back into Celsius you should divide by <M>{"\\tfrac95"}</M> and then take away 32. Try it on
        100&deg;C. What went wrong, and what is the right rule?
      </p>
      <p>
        And here is a harder one: the squaring function turns 3 into 9. Is there a function that turns every square back
        into the number it came from?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        100&deg;C becomes <M>{"100 \\cdot \\tfrac95 + 32 = 212"}</M>&deg;F. The friend&rsquo;s rule gives{" "}
        <M>{"212 \\div \\tfrac95 - 32 \\approx 85.8"}</M>, which is wrong. To undo a sequence of steps, undo them in{" "}
        <em>reverse order</em>, as you take off your shoes before your socks: first take away 32, then divide by{" "}
        <M>{"\\tfrac95"}</M>. That gives <M>{"180 \\cdot \\tfrac59 = 100"}</M>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Squaring is harder to undo, because 3 and <M>{"-3"}</M> both go to 9: from 9 alone you cannot tell which one you
        started with. A function can be undone only if it never sends two inputs to the same output. On a graph, undoing
        swaps the roles of <M>x</M> and <M>y</M>, which is reflection in the line <M>{"y = x"}</M>. Watch what the
        reflection does to a function that is one-to-one, and to one that is not.

      <Theorem title="when an inverse exists">
        <p>A function has an inverse exactly when it is one-to-one. The inverse, when it exists, is unique.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <M>f</M> has an inverse <M>g</M>. If <M>{"f(x_1) = f(x_2)"}</M>, apply <M>g</M> to both sides:{" "}
          <M>{"x_1 = g(f(x_1)) = g(f(x_2)) = x_2"}</M>. So <M>f</M> is one-to-one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, suppose <M>f</M> is one-to-one. Each <M>y</M> in the range is <M>{"f(x)"}</M> for some <M>x</M>,
          and for only one <M>x</M>, since two would contradict being one-to-one. Define <M>{"g(y)"}</M> to be that{" "}
          <M>x</M>. Then <M>{"g(f(x)) = x"}</M> and <M>{"f(g(y)) = y"}</M> by construction. Uniqueness: any inverse must
          send <M>{"f(x)"}</M> to <M>x</M>, so it agrees with <M>g</M> everywhere.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <p>
        To find a formula for an inverse, write <M>{"y = f(x)"}</M> and solve for <M>x</M> in terms of <M>y</M>. If
        there is exactly one solution for each <M>y</M> in the range, that solution is <M>{"f^{-1}(y)"}</M>.

      <Example title="Celsius and Fahrenheit">
        <p>
          <M>{"F = \\tfrac95 C + 32"}</M>. Solving: <M>{"F - 32 = \\tfrac95 C"}</M>, so{" "}
          <M>{"C = \\tfrac59(F - 32)"}</M>. The steps of the inverse are the steps of the original, each undone, in
          reverse order.

      </Example>

      <Proposition title="shoes and socks">
        <p>
          If <M>f</M> and <M>g</M> both have inverses and <M>{"g \\circ f"}</M> is defined, then{" "}
          <M>{"(g \\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"(f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1})((g \\circ f)(x)) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(g(f(x)))) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x"}</M>, and the same
          calculation in the other order gives <M>{"(g \\circ f)(f^{-1}(g^{-1}(y))) = y"}</M>. By uniqueness of inverses,{" "}
          <M>{"f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}"}</M> is the inverse.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="making a function invertible">
        <p>
          Squaring on all the reals is not one-to-one, so it has no inverse. Restrict its domain to <M>{"x \\ge 0"}</M> and
          it becomes one-to-one, with inverse <M>{"\\sqrt{y}"}</M>. This is why <M>{"\\sqrt{9}"}</M> means 3, never{" "}
          <M>{"-3"}</M>: the square root is the inverse of a <em>restricted</em> squaring function, and{" "}
          <M>{"\\sqrt{x^2} = |x|"}</M>, not <M>x</M>. Logarithms and the inverse trigonometric functions are built the same
          way. Note also that <M>{"f^{-1}(x)"}</M> means the inverse, not <M>{"\\tfrac{1}{f(x)}"}</M>; the notation is
          unfortunate but universal.

      Next, transforming graphs: shifting, stretching and reflecting are compositions with very simple functions. The
      logarithm arrives as the inverse of an exponential function, and the inverse trigonometric functions by restricting
      domains, exactly as here. In Foundations, one-to-one is paired with onto, and functions with both properties, the
      bijections, are exactly those with two-sided inverses. Calculus finds the slope of an inverse function, and Linear
      Algebra asks which matrices can be undone.
