  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        A car drives at a steady 60 km per hour. Its engine burns 8 litres of fuel per 100 km. How fast is it burning fuel,
        in litres per hour?
      </p>
      <p>
        You will probably multiply without a second thought. Now: how fast is <M>{"\\sin(x^2)"}</M> changing when{" "}
        <M>{"x = 1"}</M>? It is the same question in disguise.
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The car turns hours into kilometres at 60 per hour, and kilometres into litres at 0.08 per kilometre. Rates in a chain
        multiply: <M>{"60 \\times 0.08 = 4.8"}</M> litres per hour. A composite function <M>{"f(g(x))"}</M> is a chain of
        the same kind: x is turned into <M>{"u = g(x)"}</M>, and u into <M>{"y = f(u)"}</M>. Near a point, each step
        stretches small intervals by its derivative, and the stretches multiply.

      <Theorem title="the chain rule">
        <p>
          If g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at <M>{"g(x)"}</M>, then <M>{"f \\circ g"}</M> is differentiable
          at x, and
        </p>
        <MD>{"(f \\circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)."}</MD>
        <p>
          In Leibniz&rsquo;s notation, with <M>{"y = f(u)"}</M> and <M>{"u = g(x)"}</M>:{" "}
          <M>{"\\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\dfrac{du}{dx}"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Theorem>

      <Remark title="a tempting proof, and its flaw">
        <p>Write <M>{"k = g(x + h) - g(x)"}</M>. It is tempting to argue</p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h} = \\frac{f(g(x) + k) - f(g(x))}{k} \\cdot \\frac{k}{h},"}</MD>
        <p>
          and note that <M>{"k \\to 0"}</M> as <M>{"h \\to 0"}</M>, so the first factor tends to <M>{"f'(g(x))"}</M> and the
          second to <M>{"g'(x)"}</M>. The flaw: k might be 0 for some small h (if g is constant near x, or oscillates), and
          then we have divided by zero. Leibniz&rsquo;s notation, which makes the rule look like cancelling fractions, hides
          exactly this problem.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Proof>
        <p>
          Define <M>{"\\varphi(k) = \\dfrac{f(g(x) + k) - f(g(x))}{k}"}</M> for <M>{"k \\ne 0"}</M>, and{" "}
          <M>{"\\varphi(0) = f'(g(x))"}</M>. Since f is differentiable at <M>{"g(x)"}</M>, <M>{"\\varphi"}</M> is continuous at
          0. For every k, including 0,
        </p>
        <MD>{"f(g(x) + k) - f(g(x)) = \\varphi(k)\\, k."}</MD>
        <p>Put <M>{"k = g(x + h) - g(x)"}</M> and divide by <M>{"h \\ne 0"}</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"\\frac{f(g(x + h)) - f(g(x))}{h} = \\varphi\\big(g(x + h) - g(x)\\big) \\cdot \\frac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h}."}</MD>
        <p>
          As <M>{"h \\to 0"}</M>, <M>{"g(x + h) - g(x) \\to 0"}</M> because g is continuous at x, so the first factor tends to{" "}
          <M>{"\\varphi(0) = f'(g(x))"}</M> by continuity of <M>{"\\varphi"}</M>; the second tends to <M>{"g'(x)"}</M>. No
          division by k ever happens.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="outside, then inside">
        <p>
          Differentiate the outer function, leaving the inside alone, then multiply by the derivative of the inside:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\sin(x^2) = \\cos(x^2) \\cdot 2x"}</M>. At <M>{"x = 1"}</M> this is <M>{"2\\cos 1 \\approx 1.08"}</M>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}(3x + 1)^{10} = 10(3x + 1)^9 \\cdot 3"}</M>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \\cdot 2x = \\dfrac{x}{\\sqrt{1 + x^2}}"}</M>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Example>

      <Example title="chains of three">
        <p>
          The rule extends to longer chains by applying it repeatedly:{" "}
          <M>{"\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\cos^3(5x) = 3\\cos^2(5x) \\cdot (-\\sin 5x) \\cdot 5"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="units as a check">
        <p>
          The chain rule is what makes units of measurement work. If y is in litres, u in kilometres and x in hours, then{" "}
          <M>{"dy/du"}</M> is in litres per kilometre and <M>{"du/dx"}</M> in kilometres per hour, and their product is in
          litres per hour. When the units of an answer come out wrong, a factor from the chain rule has usually gone missing.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The chain rule runs backwards as integration by substitution, and it powers the related-rates problems of the next
      chapter. In Real Analysis II: Metric Spaces and Analysis in Rⁿ, the derivative becomes a matrix, and the chain rule
      becomes matrix multiplication.
