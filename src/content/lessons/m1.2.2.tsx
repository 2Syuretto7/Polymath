      <p>Work out <M>{"n^2 + n + 41"}</M> for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. You get 41, 43, 47, 53, 61: all prime.</p>
      <p>
        Euler noticed in 1772 that this goes on: every value up to n = 39 is prime. Forty successes in a row. Is{" "}
        <M>{"n^2 + n + 41"}</M> prime for <em>every</em> whole number n? Before reading on, try n = 40, and then n = 41.
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        At n = 40 the value is <M>{"1600 + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41^2"}</M>, which is not prime. Forty examples did not prove
        &ldquo;for every n&rdquo;; one counterexample was enough to refute it. At n = 41 the value is plainly divisible by 41
        too.

        The previous lesson turned a predicate into a statement by filling in a value. Here is the other way: say how many
        values make it true. &ldquo;<strong>For all</strong> x&rdquo; claims every element works; &ldquo;
        <strong>there exists</strong> an x&rdquo; claims at least one does. Try both below, and watch the domain change the
        verdict.

        <p>The puzzle shows an asymmetry worth memorising:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to prove <M>{"\\forall x\\, P(x)"}</M>, take an <em>arbitrary</em> x and show P(x) using nothing special about it;</li>

          <li>to prove <M>{"\\exists x\\, P(x)"}</M>, produce one <strong>witness</strong>;</li>

      <Example title="vacuous truth">
        <p>
          &ldquo;Every elephant in this room is pink&rdquo; is <M>{"\\forall x\\,(E(x) \\to P(x))"}</M>. If there are no
          elephants in the room, then <M>{"E(x)"}</M> is false for every x, so every instance of the conditional is true, and
          so is the statement. A universal claim about nothing is <strong>vacuously true</strong>, while the matching
          existential claim, &ldquo;some elephant in this room is pink&rdquo;, is false.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      To use quantifiers in proofs you must be able to deny them, and that is the next lesson: what is the opposite of
      &ldquo;every&rdquo;? After that come statements with several quantifiers, where order matters a great deal. Existence
      proofs, and Euclid&rsquo;s proof that there are infinitely many primes, are built on these foundations.
