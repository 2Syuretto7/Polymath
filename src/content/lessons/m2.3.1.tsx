  puzzle: (

      <p>
        A popular description says a function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting your pen. Try it on{" "}
        <M>{"f(x) = 1/x"}</M>. You must lift your pen at <M>{"x = 0"}</M>. Yet 0 is not in the domain of f, and at every
        point where f is defined, nothing seems to go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>Is <M>{"1/x"}</M> continuous or not? And what should &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; mean, if the pen test gives the wrong answer?</p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Continuity is a property of a function <em>at a point</em>. A function is continuous at a if its value there is what
        the nearby values lead you to expect: the limit at a exists and equals f(a). Small changes in x then produce small
        changes in f(x). There are several ways this can fail, shown below. Only one of them can be repaired by changing a
        single value.

      <Definition title="continuity">
        <p>
          Let f be defined on an open interval containing a. Then f is <strong>continuous at a</strong> if
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)."}</MD>
        <p>
          In epsilon-delta form: for every <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M> there is a <M>{"\\delta > 0"}</M> such that{" "}
          <M>{"|x - a| < \\delta"}</M> implies <M>{"|f(x) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon"}</M>. (The condition <M>{"0 < |x - a|"}</M>{" "}
          is no longer needed, since at <M>{"x = a"}</M> the difference is 0.) f is <strong>continuous</strong> if it is
          continuous at every point of its domain. At an endpoint of a closed interval, we use the one-sided limit.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="three conditions">
        <p>
          The definition packs in three demands: f(a) must be defined, the limit at a must exist, and the two must be equal.
          The visualisation shows each failing: an infinite or oscillating discontinuity, or a jump, has no limit; a removable
          discontinuity has a limit that disagrees with the value.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="the puzzle answered">
        <p>
          <M>{"1/x"}</M> is continuous at every a &ne; 0, by the quotient law. Since 0 is not in its domain, the question of
          continuity at 0 does not arise, and <M>{"1/x"}</M> is a continuous function. The pen test fails because the domain
          has two separate pieces. On a single interval, the pen test is a fair picture of continuity.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Theorem title="building continuous functions">
        <p>If f and g are continuous at a, then so are <M>{"f + g"}</M>, <M>{"f - g"}</M>, <M>{"fg"}</M>, and <M>{"f/g"}</M> provided <M>{"g(a) \\ne 0"}</M>.</p>
        <p>
          If g is continuous at a and f is continuous at <M>{"g(a)"}</M>, then <M>{"f \\circ g"}</M> is continuous at a.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          The first part is the limit laws, with <M>{"L = f(a)"}</M> and <M>{"M = g(a)"}</M>. For composition, let{" "}
          <M>{"\\varepsilon > 0"}</M>. Since f is continuous at <M>{"g(a)"}</M>, there is an <M>{"\\eta > 0"}</M> with{" "}
          <M>{"|f(y) - f(g(a))| < \\varepsilon"}</M> whenever <M>{"|y - g(a)| < \\eta"}</M>. Since g is continuous at a, there
          is a <M>{"\\delta > 0"}</M> with <M>{"|g(x) - g(a)| < \\eta"}</M> whenever <M>{"|x - a| < \\delta"}</M>. Putting{" "}
          <M>{"y = g(x)"}</M>, <M>{"|x - a| < \\delta"}</M> gives <M>{"|f(g(x)) - f(g(a))| < \\varepsilon"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example title="a large stock of continuous functions">
        <p>
          Constants and x are continuous, so by the theorem every polynomial is continuous everywhere, and every rational
          function is continuous wherever its denominator is not 0. So are <M>{"\\sqrt{x}"}</M> on <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M>,
          sine and cosine, the exponential and the logarithm, though their proofs must wait until they are defined properly.
          Compositions such as <M>{"\\sqrt{1 + \\sin^2 x}"}</M> are then continuous too.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="a function continuous at exactly one point">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"f(x) = x"}</M> if x is rational and <M>{"f(x) = 0"}</M> if x is irrational. At 0, <M>{"|f(x) - f(0)| \\le |x|"}</M>,
          so <M>{"\\delta = \\varepsilon"}</M> works and f is continuous. At any <M>{"a \\ne 0"}</M>, there are rationals and
          irrationals arbitrarily close to a, with values near a and equal to 0, so the limit does not exist. No pen could
          draw this graph, yet the definition handles it without trouble.

      The next two lessons prove the two great theorems about continuous functions on intervals. Real Analysis I takes
      continuity further, and later courses strip away the numbers altogether: Real Analysis II: Metric Spaces and Analysis in
      Rⁿ defines it using any distance, and Topology using only open sets.
