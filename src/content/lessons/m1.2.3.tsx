      <p>A teacher claims: &ldquo;Every student in this class has read a book by Tagore.&rdquo; You think the teacher is wrong.</p>
      <p>
        What exactly must you show? That no student has read a book by Tagore? That every student has failed to? Something
        else? Write down the precise opposite of the teacher&rsquo;s claim before reading on.
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        To refute &ldquo;every student has read a book by Tagore&rdquo;, you need only one student who has read none. The
        opposite of &ldquo;every&rdquo; is not &ldquo;none&rdquo;; it is &ldquo;at least one does not&rdquo;. In the same
        way, the opposite of &ldquo;some student has read Tagore&rdquo; is &ldquo;every student has failed to&rdquo;.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when a &ldquo;not&rdquo; passes a quantifier, the quantifier flips: <M>{"\\forall"}</M> becomes{" "}
        <M>{"\\exists"}</M> and <M>{"\\exists"}</M> becomes <M>{"\\forall"}</M>. Step through some examples below; the last
        one passes two quantifiers.

      <Proposition title="De Morgan's laws for quantifiers">
        <p>For any predicate P over any domain,</p>
        <MD>{"\\neg\\, \\forall x\\, P(x) \\equiv \\exists x\\, \\neg P(x) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\neg\\, \\exists x\\, P(x) \\equiv \\forall x\\, \\neg P(x)."}</MD>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"\\forall x\\, P(x)"}</M> is false exactly when the truth set of P misses some element of the domain, that is,
          exactly when some x makes <M>{"\\neg P(x)"}</M> true. That is the first law. For the second, apply the first to the
          predicate <M>{"\\neg P"}</M>: <M>{"\\neg \\forall x\\, \\neg P(x) \\equiv \\exists x\\, P(x)"}</M>. Negate both sides
          and cancel the double negation.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="why De Morgan's name">
        <p>
          On a finite domain <M>{"\\{a_1, \\dots, a_n\\}"}</M>, &ldquo;for all&rdquo; is a long &ldquo;and&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;there exists&rdquo; a long &ldquo;or&rdquo;:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\forall x\\, P(x) \\equiv P(a_1) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge P(a_n), \\qquad \\exists x\\, P(x) \\equiv P(a_1) \\vee \\cdots \\vee P(a_n)."}</MD>
        <p>The quantifier laws are then exactly De Morgan&rsquo;s laws from propositional logic, stretched to many terms.</p>
      </Remark>

      <Proposition title="the working rule">
        <p>
          To negate a statement, move the <M>{"\\neg"}</M> from left to right, flipping each quantifier it passes, until it
          sits on the predicate; then simplify the inside with the propositional laws, especially
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\neg (A \\to B) \\equiv A \\wedge \\neg B."}</MD>
        <p>In particular, <M>{"\\neg \\forall x\\,(P(x) \\to Q(x)) \\equiv \\exists x\\,(P(x) \\wedge \\neg Q(x))"}</M>: to deny that every P is Q, find a P that is not Q.</p>
      </Proposition>

      <Example title="unbounded, precisely">
        <p>
          A function f is <strong>bounded</strong> if some number M caps its size everywhere:{" "}
          <M>{"\\exists M\\, \\forall x\\ |f(x)| \\le M"}</M>. Negating mechanically,
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\neg\\, \\exists M\\, \\forall x\\ |f(x)| \\le M \\;\\equiv\\; \\forall M\\, \\exists x\\ |f(x)| > M."}</MD>
        <p>
          So f is unbounded when, whatever cap M you propose, some x breaks it. For <M>{"f(x) = x^2"}</M> on the reals, given
          M take <M>{"x = M + 1"}</M>; then <M>{"x^2 \\ge x > M"}</M> when <M>{"M \\ge 0"}</M>, and any x at all breaks a
          negative M. Analysis is full of such negations, and doing them by rule saves much confusion.

      <Remark title="all that glisters">
        <p>
          In <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite> a scroll reads &ldquo;All that glisters is not gold&rdquo;. Read literally
          this is <M>{"\\forall x\\,(G(x) \\to \\neg O(x))"}</M>: nothing that glisters is gold, which is false of gold
          itself. What is meant is <M>{"\\neg \\forall x\\,(G(x) \\to O(x))"}</M>: not all that glisters is gold. Where a
          &ldquo;not&rdquo; sits relative to &ldquo;all&rdquo; changes the meaning, and English is careless about it.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The stretch exercise used three quantifiers in a row, and the next lesson is about exactly that: statements with
      several quantifiers, where the order of &ldquo;for all&rdquo; and &ldquo;there exists&rdquo; matters. Negation is the
      heart of proof by contradiction, and the convergence definition returns in Calculus and in Real Analysis.
