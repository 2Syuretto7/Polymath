  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        At school you were probably told that &ldquo;a minus times a minus is a plus&rdquo;. Why should that be true?
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to give a <em>reason</em>, not a rule. If someone insisted that <M>{"(-1) \\times (-1) = -1"}</M>, what exactly
        would go wrong?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        In the natural numbers you can always add, but you cannot always subtract: <M>{"3 - 5"}</M> has no answer among
        0, 1, 2, and so on. Yet the question makes perfect sense. A thermometer at 3 degrees that falls by 5 shows
        something. A bank account with 3 rupees that pays out 5 is 2 rupees in debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we extend the number line to the left of 0. A number now has a size <em>and</em> a direction. Adding a
        positive number moves you right; adding a negative number moves you left; subtracting is the same as adding the
        opposite. Multiplying by <M>{"-1"}</M> turns you around through 0, and turning around twice leaves you facing
        the way you started. That is the picture behind the rule you were taught. Play with it below.
      </p>
      <SignedMovesViz />
      <p>
        The picture is suggestive, but a picture is not a reason. The real reason is better: once we insist that the
        new numbers obey the same laws as the old ones, the rule for signs is <em>forced</em>. There is no other choice.

      <Definition title="the integers">
        <p>
          The <strong>integers</strong> are the numbers <M>{"\\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots"}</M>. We write{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{Z}"}</M> for the set of all of them (from the German <em>Zahlen</em>, numbers). For each natural
          number <M>n</M> there is an integer <M>{"-n"}</M>, its <strong>negative</strong>, with{" "}
          <M>{"n + (-n) = 0"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <p>
        We want arithmetic on <M>{"\\mathbb{Z}"}</M> to behave like arithmetic on the natural numbers. So we ask that the
        following laws hold for all integers <M>a</M>, <M>b</M>, <M>c</M>. They are the rules you have always used,
        written down so that we can see exactly what each step of an argument rests on.

      <Definition title="subtraction">

        Before the main theorem we need two small facts. Each proof uses only the laws above; read them slowly and name

      <Theorem title="cancellation">
        <p>If <M>{"x + a = a"}</M>, then <M>{"x = 0"}</M>. More generally, if <M>{"x + a = y + a"}</M>, then <M>{"x = y"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Add <M>{"-a"}</M> to both sides of <M>{"x + a = y + a"}</M> and regroup:</p>
        <MD>{"x = x + 0 = x + (a + (-a)) = (x + a) + (-a) = (y + a) + (-a) = y + (a + (-a)) = y + 0 = y."}</MD>
        <p>The first statement is the case <M>{"y = 0"}</M>, since <M>{"0 + a = a"}</M>.</p>

      <Theorem title="zero absorbs">
        <p>For every integer <M>a</M>, <M>{"a \\cdot 0 = 0"}</M>.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Since <M>{"0 + 0 = 0"}</M>, distributivity gives <M>{"a \\cdot 0 = a(0 + 0) = a \\cdot 0 + a \\cdot 0"}</M>.
          Written as <M>{"0 + a \\cdot 0 = a \\cdot 0 + a \\cdot 0"}</M>, cancellation gives <M>{"0 = a \\cdot 0"}</M>.

      </Proof>

      <Theorem title="the rule of signs">
        <p>For all integers <M>a</M> and <M>b</M>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><M>{"(-1)a = -a"}</M>;</li>
          <li><M>{"-(-a) = a"}</M>;</li>
          <li><M>{"(-a)(-b) = ab"}</M>. In particular <M>{"(-1)(-1) = 1"}</M>.</li>
        </ol>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <em>(1)</em> We show that <M>{"(-1)a"}</M> does the job of <M>{"-a"}</M>, which is to add to <M>a</M> and give 0:
        </p>
        <MD>{"a + (-1)a = 1 \\cdot a + (-1)a = (1 + (-1))a = 0 \\cdot a = 0."}</MD>
        <p>
          So <M>{"a + (-1)a = 0 = a + (-a)"}</M>, and cancellation (with <M>a</M> on the left, using commutativity) gives{" "}
          <M>{"(-1)a = -a"}</M>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(2)</em> <M>{"-(-a)"}</M> is the number that adds to <M>{"-a"}</M> to give 0. But <M>a</M> already does
          that, since <M>{"(-a) + a = 0"}</M>. By cancellation the two are equal.
        </p>
        <p><em>(3)</em> Using (1) twice, commutativity and associativity, then (1) and (2):</p>
        <MD>{"(-a)(-b) = ((-1)a)((-1)b) = (-1)\\big((-1)(ab)\\big) = (-1)(-(ab)) = -(-(ab)) = ab."}</MD>
      </Proof>

      <p>
        Now the puzzle has an answer. If <M>{"(-1)(-1)"}</M> were <M>{"-1"}</M>, distributivity would fail:{" "}
        <M>{"(-1)\\big(1 + (-1)\\big)"}</M> must be <M>{"(-1) \\cdot 0 = 0"}</M>, but it would also be{" "}
        <M>{"(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 + (-1) = -2"}</M>. The sign rule is the price of keeping the laws.

      <Definition title="order">
        <p>
          We say <M>{"a < b"}</M> if <M>{"b - a"}</M> is a positive integer, that is, one of <M>{"1, 2, 3, \\ldots"}</M>.
          On the number line, <M>a</M> lies to the left of <M>b</M>.

      <Theorem title="multiplying an inequality">
        <p>
          If <M>{"a < b"}</M> and <M>{"c > 0"}</M> then <M>{"ac < bc"}</M>. If <M>{"a < b"}</M> and <M>{"c < 0"}</M>{" "}
          then <M>{"ac > bc"}</M>: multiplying by a negative number reverses an inequality.
        </p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          <M>{"bc - ac = (b - a)c"}</M> by distributivity. If <M>c</M> is positive, this is a product of two positive
          integers, which is positive, so <M>{"ac < bc"}</M>. If <M>c</M> is negative, write <M>{"c = -d"}</M> with{" "}
          <M>d</M> positive. Then <M>{"(b - a)c = -\\big((b - a)d\\big)"}</M> is the negative of a positive integer, so{" "}
          <M>{"ac - bc"}</M> is positive and <M>{"ac > bc"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Example>
        <p>
          <M>{"2 < 5"}</M>, but <M>{"2 \\cdot (-3) = -6"}</M> and <M>{"5 \\cdot (-3) = -15"}</M>, and <M>{"-6 > -15"}</M>.
          Turning around through 0 reverses left and right.

      </Example>

      <Remark title="what the integers really are">
        <p>
          We spoke as if the negative numbers were simply there, waiting. A mathematician can build them from the
          natural numbers alone. Think of a pair <M>{"(a, b)"}</M> of natural numbers as standing for &ldquo;
          <M>a</M> minus <M>b</M>&rdquo;, and count two pairs as the same integer when <M>{"a + d = b + c"}</M>. Then{" "}
          <M>{"(2, 7)"}</M> and <M>{"(0, 5)"}</M> are both <M>{"-5"}</M>. Notice that the test uses only addition, which the
          natural numbers already have. This trick, building new objects as classes of old ones, returns in Proof and
          Logic as an equivalence relation, and again whenever mathematics needs new numbers.
