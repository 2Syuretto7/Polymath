      <p>Look at the powers of 11:</p>
      <MD>{"11^0 = 1, \\quad 11^1 = 11, \\quad 11^2 = 121, \\quad 11^3 = 1331, \\quad 11^4 = 14641."}</MD>

        Read the digits as rows, and stack them in a triangle. What rule makes each row from the one above? And why should
        powers of 11 have anything to do with expanding <M>{"(1 + x)^n"}</M>?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Since <M>{"11 = 10 + 1"}</M>, a power of 11 is <M>{"(10 + 1)^n"}</M>, and expanding <M>{"(x + 1)^n"}</M> gives the
        same coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 for <M>{"n = 4"}</M>. Each row comes from the one above by adding neighbours, because
        multiplying by <M>{"(1 + x)"}</M> adds each coefficient to the one beside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the numbers are old friends: 6 is <M>{"\\binom42"}</M>, the number of ways to choose 2 things from 4. Expanding{" "}
        <M>{"(1 + x)^4"}</M> means choosing, from each of the four brackets, either the 1 or the <M>x</M>; the coefficient of{" "}
        <M>{"x^2"}</M> counts the ways to choose which two brackets supply an <M>x</M>. (The pattern of digits breaks at{" "}
        <M>{"11^5"}</M>, where the coefficients 10 start to carry.)

      <Definition title="Pascal’s triangle">
        <p>
          Row <M>n</M> of <strong>Pascal&rsquo;s triangle</strong>, counting the top as row 0, lists{" "}
          <M>{"\\binom{n}{0}, \\binom{n}{1}, \\ldots, \\binom{n}{n}"}</M>.

      <Proposition title="Pascal’s rule">
        <p>For <M>{"1 \\le r \\le n"}</M>, <M>{"\\binom{n+1}{r} = \\binom{n}{r-1} + \\binom{n}{r}"}</M>.</p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Choose <M>r</M> people from a group of <M>{"n + 1"}</M>, one of whom is Asha. Either Asha is chosen, and the other{" "}
          <M>{"r - 1"}</M> come from the remaining <M>n</M>, in <M>{"\\binom{n}{r-1}"}</M> ways; or she is not, and all{" "}

      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Multiply out <M>{"(a + b)(a + b)\\cdots(a + b)"}</M>, with <M>n</M> brackets, by choosing one letter from each
          bracket in every possible way and adding the products. A product equals <M>{"a^{n-r}b^r"}</M> exactly when{" "}
          <M>b</M> was chosen from <M>r</M> of the brackets, and there are <M>{"\\binom{n}{r}"}</M> ways to pick which{" "}
          <M>r</M>. (Induction with Pascal&rsquo;s rule gives a second proof.)

        </p>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Put <M>{"a = b = 1"}</M> in the binomial theorem, then <M>{"a = 1"}</M>, <M>{"b = -1"}</M>. The first also has a
          counting proof: both sides count all the subsets of a set of <M>n</M> things, since each thing is either in or out.

          later terms shrink so fast that the first few give the answer to four decimal places, a trick for compound interest
          long before calculators.

      <Remark title="a triangle with many names">
        <p>
          The triangle is called Pascal&rsquo;s after Blaise Pascal&rsquo;s treatise of 1654, but it is much older. The
          tenth-century commentator Halayudha described it, as the <em>meru-prastāra</em>, the staircase of Mount Meru, to
          count Pingala&rsquo;s metres. In Persia it is linked with al-Karaji and Omar Khayyam, in China it is Yang Hui&rsquo;s
          triangle, from his book of 1261. Shade its odd entries, as in the picture, and a pattern appears that the Polish
          mathematician Wacław Sierpiński studied in 1915, a shape made of smaller copies of itself.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      This completes the Foundations of School Mathematics. Newton extended the binomial theorem to powers that are not whole
      numbers, which leads in Calculus to Taylor series. In Discrete Mathematics the triangle hides dozens of identities, and
      in Probability the binomial coefficients give the chance of <M>r</M> heads in <M>n</M> tosses of a coin.
