  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>
        A car&rsquo;s speedometer reads 50 km per hour at a certain instant. But speed is distance divided by time, and in a
        single instant the car covers no distance in no time. So the speed at an instant seems to be <M>{"0/0"}</M>, which is
        meaningless. What, then, is the speedometer measuring?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a simpler version of the same puzzle. What is the value of <M>{"\\dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}"}</M> when{" "}
        <M>{"x = 1"}</M>?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        At <M>{"x = 1"}</M> the expression is <M>{"0/0"}</M>, so it has no value there. But we can ask a different question:
        what happens to the value as x gets <em>close</em> to 1? At 0.9 it is 1.9; at 0.99 it is 1.99; at 1.01 it is 2.01. The
        values are homing in on 2. We say the <strong>limit</strong> as x tends to 1 is 2. Speed at an instant is a limit of
        the same kind: the average speed over shorter and shorter stretches of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose a function and slide h towards 0. The two red points sit at <M>{"a - h"}</M> and <M>{"a + h"}</M>, one on
        each side of a.

  theory: (
    <>
      <Definition title="limit (informal)">
        <p>We write</p>
        <MD>{"\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L"}</MD>
        <p>
          if f(x) can be made as close to L as we like by taking x close enough to a, but not equal to a. In words: the limit
          of f(x) as x tends to a is L. We also write <M>{"f(x) \\to L"}</M> as <M>{"x \\to a"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="the value at a does not matter">
        <p>
          The definition ignores what happens at <M>{"x = a"}</M> itself. f need not be defined at a, as with{" "}
          <M>{"(x^2 - 1)/(x - 1)"}</M> at 1. And if it is defined, its value there may differ from the limit: if we set{" "}
          <M>{"g(x) = x + 1"}</M> for <M>{"x \\ne 1"}</M> and <M>{"g(1) = 7"}</M>, the limit at 1 is still 2. Limits describe
          how a function behaves near a point, not at it.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Example title="simplifying first">
        <p>
          For <M>{"x \\ne 1"}</M>, <M>{"\\dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \\dfrac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} = x + 1"}</M>. Near 1, x + 1
          is near 2. So
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 2."}</MD>
        <p>
          Cancelling <M>{"x - 1"}</M> is allowed precisely because the limit never looks at <M>{"x = 1"}</M>, where it would
          mean dividing by zero.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="two ways for a limit to fail">
        <p>
          A limit can fail to exist in several ways. For <M>{"x / |x|"}</M> at 0, the values approach different numbers from
          the two sides, so no single L works. For <M>{"\\sin(1/x)"}</M> at 0, the values oscillate between <M>{"-1"}</M> and
          1 forever, approaching nothing at all. A third way, values growing without bound, is the subject of a later lesson.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="tables of values can deceive">
        <p>
          Guessing a limit from a few values is risky. Take <M>{"f(x) = \\sin(\\pi / x)"}</M> and try{" "}
          <M>{"x = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \\ldots"}</M>. Every value is <M>{"\\sin(10^k \\pi) = 0"}</M>, so the table suggests
          the limit is 0. But at <M>{"x = 2/(4k + 1)"}</M>, which also approaches 0, f(x) is 1. There is no limit. The informal
          definition is a good guide, but it says &ldquo;as close as we like&rdquo; without saying how to check that. The next
          lesson makes it precise, so that limits can be proved rather than guessed.

      <Remark title="where limits lead">
        <p>
          Almost everything in this course is a limit. The derivative is the limit of slopes of chords; the integral is the
          limit of sums of thin rectangles; the sum of an infinite series is the limit of its partial sums. Newton and Leibniz
          used limits successfully for a century and a half before anyone could say exactly what they were.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      The informal idea of a limit carries the whole course: derivatives, integrals and infinite series are all limits. The next
      lesson gives the exact definition, and Real Analysis I builds the theory of limits of functions on it with full rigour.
