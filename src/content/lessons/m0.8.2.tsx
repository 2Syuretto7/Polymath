      <p>Add up the first few odd numbers:</p>

        What do you notice about the answers? Will it always happen? And how could you write &ldquo;the sum of the first
        thousand odd numbers&rdquo; without writing a thousand numbers?

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        The sums are 1, 4, 9, 16: the square numbers. The picture explains why: each odd number is an L-shaped layer that
        wraps round a square to make the next square up. The Greeks called such an L a <em>gnomon</em>, after the upright
        of a sundial.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the writing problem, mathematicians use a capital Greek sigma, <M>{"\\Sigma"}</M>, for &ldquo;sum&rdquo;. The
        sum of the first thousand odd numbers is <M>{"\\sum_{k=1}^{1000} (2k - 1)"}</M>: let <M>k</M> run from 1 to 1000, work
        out <M>{"2k - 1"}</M> each time, and add.

          The letter <M>k</M> is the <strong>index</strong>. It is a placeholder, like the <M>x</M> in a function: any other
          letter not already in use would do.

      <Proposition title="rules for sums">
        <p>For numbers <M>c</M> and sequences <M>{"a_k"}</M>, <M>{"b_k"}</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k + b_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k, \\qquad \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c\\,a_k = c\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k, \\qquad \\sum_{k=1}^{n} c = nc."}</MD>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          Write each side out in full. The first rule rearranges the terms, the second takes out a common factor, and the
          third adds <M>n</M> copies of <M>c</M>. Nothing more than the laws of arithmetic from the first chapter.

      <Proposition title="standard sums">
        <MD>{"\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \\qquad \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = n^2, \\qquad \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}."}</MD>
      </Proposition>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          The first is the arithmetic sum of the last lesson. The second follows from the rules:{" "}
          <M>{"\\sum (2k - 1) = 2\\sum k - \\sum 1 = n(n+1) - n = n^2"}</M>. The third is harder to discover; checking it for{" "}
          <M>{"n = 1, 2, 3"}</M> gives 1, 5, 14, which match, but checking is not proving. The next lesson gives a method,
          induction, that proves it for every <M>n</M>.

      <Definition title="telescoping sums">
        <p>If each term is a difference <M>{"a_k = b_{k+1} - b_k"}</M>, nearly everything cancels:</p>

      <Example title="a telescope">

      <Remark title="Aryabhata’s sums">
        <p>
          The formulas for the sum of the squares and the sum of the cubes appear in the <em>Āryabhaṭīya</em>, written by
          Aryabhata in 499 CE, alongside a rule for the number of balls in a pile stacked as a triangular pyramid. The sigma itself
          is much younger: Leonhard Euler introduced it in 1755. Good notation is an invention too, and often an underrated
          one.

    <p>
      Next, induction, the method for proving a formula like the sum of squares for every <M>n</M> at once. In Calculus, the
      area under a curve is first approximated by a sum of thin rectangles, written in exactly this notation, and the sum of
      squares is what lets you compute the area under a parabola by hand.
