      <p>
        A restaurant offers pizza with any combination of five toppings: none, all five, or anything in between. How many
        different pizzas can you order?
      </p>
      <p>
        And a second question: a shirt comes in 4 colours and 3 sizes. How many different shirts are there? Both questions
        ask you to count a new set built from old ones. Before reading on, try to see why one answer is a power of 2 and the
        other a product.
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        For each topping there are two choices, in or out. Five independent two-way choices give{" "}
        <M>{"2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32"}</M> pizzas. Each pizza is a <em>subset</em> of the set of
        toppings, and the collection of all of them is the <strong>power set</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the shirt, each one is a <em>pair</em>: a colour and a size. There are <M>{"4 \\times 3 = 12"}</M> pairs, and the
        set of all of them is the <strong>Cartesian product</strong>. Build the power set of a small set below, and see each
        subset as a row of in-or-out switches.

      <Definition title="power set">
        <p>
          The <strong>power set</strong> of A is the set of all subsets of A:
        </p>
        <MD>{"\\mathcal{P}(A) = \\{\\, X : X \\subseteq A \\,\\}."}</MD>
        <p>
          For example, <M>{"\\mathcal{P}(\\{a, b\\}) = \\{\\varnothing, \\{a\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{a, b\\}\\}"}</M>. Note that{" "}
          <M>{"\\varnothing"}</M> and A itself are always elements of <M>{"\\mathcal{P}(A)"}</M>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Theorem title="size of the power set">
        <p>If A has n elements, then <M>{"\\mathcal{P}(A)"}</M> has <M>{"2^n"}</M> elements.</p>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          List the elements of A as <M>{"a_1, \\dots, a_n"}</M>. A subset X is determined by answering, for each{" "}
          <M>{"a_i"}</M>, whether <M>{"a_i \\in X"}</M>. That is a string of n answers, each yes or no, and different strings
          give different subsets. There are <M>{"2^n"}</M> such strings.
        </p>
      </Proof>

      <Remark title="a familiar identity, seen again">
        <p>
          Counting the same subsets by size gives <M>{"\\binom{n}{0} + \\binom{n}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{n}{n}"}</M>, since
          there are <M>{"\\binom{n}{k}"}</M> subsets of size k. So this sum equals <M>{"2^n"}</M>: the row sums of
          Pascal&rsquo;s triangle are powers of 2. Counting one set in two ways is a proof technique in its own right.

      <Definition title="ordered pairs and Cartesian products">
        <p>
          An <strong>ordered pair</strong> <M>{"(a, b)"}</M> has a first and a second entry, and{" "}
          <M>{"(a, b) = (c, d)"}</M> exactly when <M>{"a = c"}</M> and <M>{"b = d"}</M>. Unlike a set,{" "}
          <M>{"(1, 2) \\ne (2, 1)"}</M> and <M>{"(1, 1)"}</M> is allowed. The <strong>Cartesian product</strong> of A and B is
        </p>
        <MD>{"A \\times B = \\{\\, (a, b) : a \\in A,\\ b \\in B \\,\\},"}</MD>
        <p>and if A and B are finite, <M>{"|A \\times B| = |A| \\cdot |B|"}</M>.</p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="the plane">
        <p>
          <M>{"\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}^2"}</M> is the set of all pairs of real numbers: the coordinate
          plane. The name honours René Descartes, whose <cite>La Géométrie</cite> (1637) joined algebra to geometry through
          coordinates. Similarly <M>{"\\mathbb{R}^3"}</M> is space, and <M>{"\\mathbb{R}^n"}</M> is the setting for linear
          algebra.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="pairs from sets">
        <p>
          Can ordered pairs be built from sets, which have no order? Kazimierz Kuratowski showed in 1921 that the definition{" "}
          <M>{"(a, b) = \\{\\{a\\}, \\{a, b\\}\\}"}</M> works: it satisfies the rule above. So pairs, products, and everything
          built from them can be made of sets alone, which is why set theory can serve as a foundation for mathematics.

      This completes the chapter on sets. A relation, later in this course, is simply a subset of a Cartesian product, and a
      function is a special kind of relation. Power sets return at the end of the course in Cantor&rsquo;s theorem: for every
      set, even an infinite one, the power set is strictly bigger.
