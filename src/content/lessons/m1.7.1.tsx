  puzzle: (

      <p>
        At school a function was a formula, such as <M>{"f(x) = x^2 + 1"}</M>. But consider the rule that sends each student
        in a class to their roll number, or each Indian state to its capital. No formula is involved, yet each is surely a
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        And are <M>{"f(x) = (x + 1)^2"}</M> and <M>{"g(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1"}</M> the same function or two different ones, given
        that the formulas differ? What is a function, if not a formula?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        What matters about a function is not how its values are computed but which output goes with each input. So, just as
        with relations, mathematics defines a function to be its list of input and output pairs. A function from A to B is a
        relation in which every element of A is paired with <em>exactly one</em> element of B.

        In the arrow diagrams below, that means every dot on the left sends out exactly one arrow. Try the four examples, then
        click dots on the left to change their arrows.

      <Definition title="function">
        <p>
          A <strong>function</strong> f from A to B, written <M>{"f : A \\to B"}</M>, is a relation{" "}
          <M>{"f \\subseteq A \\times B"}</M> such that for every <M>{"a \\in A"}</M> there is exactly one{" "}
          <M>{"b \\in B"}</M> with <M>{"(a, b) \\in f"}</M>. We write <M>{"f(a) = b"}</M>. The set A is the{" "}
          <strong>domain</strong> and B the <strong>codomain</strong>.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Remark title="exactly one, in two parts">
        <p>&ldquo;Exactly one&rdquo; contains two conditions, and both can fail:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>existence</strong>: every <M>{"a \\in A"}</M> has at least one partner;</li>
          <li><strong>uniqueness</strong>: no <M>{"a \\in A"}</M> has two different partners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nothing is required of B. An element of B may be the partner of many elements of A, or of none.
        </p>
      </Remark>

      <Definition title="equality of functions">
        <p>
          Two functions <M>{"f, g : A \\to B"}</M> are <strong>equal</strong> if <M>{"f(a) = g(a)"}</M> for every{" "}
          <M>{"a \\in A"}</M>. Since a function is a set of pairs, this is just equality of sets. So{" "}
          <M>{"(x + 1)^2"}</M> and <M>{"x^2 + 2x + 1"}</M> define the same function on the real numbers: two formulas, one
          function.
        </p>
      </Definition>

      <Example title="is it well defined?">
        <p>
          Try to define <M>{"f : \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Z}"}</M> by <M>{"f(p/q) = p"}</M>. Then
        </p>
        <MD>{"f\\left(\\tfrac12\\right) = 1 \\quad\\text{but}\\quad f\\left(\\tfrac24\\right) = 2,"}</MD>
        <p>
          although <M>{"\\tfrac12 = \\tfrac24"}</M>. The rule gives one input two outputs, so it fails uniqueness: it is{" "}
          <strong>not well defined</strong>. Whenever a rule refers to a particular way of writing its input, check that the
          answer does not depend on that choice.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Example title="the domain matters">
        <p>
          The rule <M>{"x \\mapsto 1/x"}</M> is not a function from <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M> to <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>, since 0
          has no partner: existence fails. It is a function from <M>{"\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}"}</M> to{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>. Similarly <M>{"x \\mapsto \\sqrt x"}</M> needs the domain <M>{"[0, \\infty)"}</M>. A
          function is not complete until its domain and codomain are specified.
        </p>
      </Example>

      <Remark title="graphs">
        <p>
          The set of pairs <M>{"\\{(x, f(x))\\}"}</M> is exactly what you draw when you sketch the graph of f. The school test
          &ldquo;every vertical line meets the graph at most once&rdquo; is uniqueness, and for a function on all of{" "}
          <M>{"\\mathbb{R}"}</M>, &ldquo;exactly once&rdquo; is the definition above.

  glimpse: (
    <p>
      Some functions never send two inputs to one output; some reach every possible output. Those that do both can be undone,
      and they are the subject of the next lesson. Continuous functions are the heart of Calculus, and in Mathematical Logic
      the question &ldquo;which functions can be computed?&rdquo; is given a precise answer.
