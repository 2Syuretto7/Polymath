  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>Here is a complete argument, written in a style common in exam scripts:</p>
      <MD>{"n \\text{ odd} \\Rightarrow n = 2k+1 \\Rightarrow n^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\Rightarrow \\text{odd} \\;\\checkmark"}</MD>
      <p>
        Is it a proof? It contains the right ideas. But what is k? What is being proved: that n is odd, or that{" "}
        <M>{"n^2"}</M> is? Why is <M>{"4k^2 + 4k + 1"}</M> odd? A proof is not only a correct argument; it is a correct
        argument that a reader can check. This lesson is about the difference.

  intuition: (

      <p>
        A proof is written for a sceptical but fair reader, often your future self. That reader should never have to guess
        what a letter means, why a step is allowed, or which method you are using. Good proofs are written in full sentences,
        with the symbols embedded in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to learn what goes wrong is to diagnose broken proofs. Each one below contains a single fatal error. Find
        the first line where the reasoning fails.

      <Definition title="a checklist for writing proofs">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>State the claim</strong> precisely, as a theorem, before the proof.</li>
          <li><strong>Announce the method</strong> if it is not direct: &ldquo;We prove the contrapositive&rdquo;, &ldquo;Suppose, for contradiction, that&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;We split into two cases.&rdquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Introduce every letter</strong> before using it, with its type: &ldquo;Let n be an odd integer. Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.&rdquo;</li>
          <li><strong>Write sentences.</strong> Symbols are nouns and verbs inside sentences; = and &lt; are verbs. Use words such as &ldquo;so&rdquo;, &ldquo;since&rdquo; and &ldquo;hence&rdquo; rather than chains of arrows.</li>
          <li><strong>Justify each step</strong> that is not routine algebra, by naming the definition or result used.</li>
          <li><strong>Finish</strong> by saying what has been shown, in the words of the claim.</li>

      <Example title="the puzzle, rewritten">
        <Theorem>
          <p>If n is an odd integer, then <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd.</p>
        </Theorem>
        <Proof>
          <p>
            Let n be an odd integer. By the definition of odd, <M>{"n = 2k + 1"}</M> for some integer k. Then
          </p>
          <MD>{"n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1."}</MD>
          <p>Since <M>{"2k^2 + 2k"}</M> is an integer, <M>{"n^2"}</M> is odd by definition.</p>
        </Proof>
        <p>It is barely longer, and nothing is left for the reader to guess.</p>

      <Remark title="five classic errors">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Proof by example.</strong> Checking a case proves a &ldquo;there exists&rdquo; statement, never a &ldquo;for all&rdquo;.</li>
          <li><strong>Proving the converse.</strong> Assuming the conclusion and deducing the hypothesis proves the wrong conditional.</li>
          <li><strong>Hidden division by zero</strong>, or by a quantity that might be zero.</li>
          <li><strong>One letter for two things.</strong> Writing m = 2k + 1 and n = 2k + 1 makes m and n equal.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>&ldquo;Clearly&rdquo;.</strong> The word is fine when the step really is clear to your intended reader. It
            is a warning sign when it covers a step you could not justify if asked.

      <Remark title="the end of a proof">
        <p>
          Many books end a proof with a small square, <M>{"\\square"}</M> or <M>{"\\blacksquare"}</M>, so the reader knows the
          argument is over. It was popularised by the mathematician Paul Halmos, and is sometimes called the{" "}
          <em>Halmos tombstone</em>. The older ending is Q.E.D., <em>quod erat demonstrandum</em>, &ldquo;which was to be
          shown&rdquo;, the Latin translation of the phrase with which Euclid ends his proofs.
