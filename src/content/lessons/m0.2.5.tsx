  puzzle: (
    <>
      <p>Two numbers add up to 13 and multiply to 40. What are they?</p>
      <p>
        You may find them by trial. Now suppose they added to 13 and multiplied to 41. Trial will not help. Is there a
        method that always works?
      </p>
    </>
  ),

  intuition: (
    <>
      <p>
        Call one number <M>x</M>; the other is <M>{"13 - x"}</M>, so <M>{"x(13 - x) = 40"}</M>, or{" "}
        <M>{"x^2 - 13x + 40 = 0"}</M>. Solving a problem like this means turning an expression such as{" "}
        <M>{"x^2 - 13x + 40"}</M> back into a product. A product is zero only when one of its factors is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying out is easy to picture as area: a rectangle with sides <M>{"x + a"}</M> and <M>{"x + b"}</M> is cut
        into a square, two strips and a small block. Factorising is reading the pieces back into a rectangle.
      </p>
      <AreaModelViz />
      <p>
        For <M>{"x^2 - 13x + 40"}</M> we want two numbers with sum <M>{"-13"}</M> and product 40: <M>{"-5"}</M> and{" "}
        <M>{"-8"}</M>. So <M>{"(x - 5)(x - 8) = 0"}</M>, and the numbers are 5 and 8. For the product 41, no such pair
        is easy to spot, and you need a method that does not rely on spotting: completing the square.

        When no factors can be spotted, <strong>completing the square</strong> always works. The identity{" "}
        <M>{"(x + h)^2 = x^2 + 2hx + h^2"}</M> says that <M>{"x^2 + 2hx"}</M> is a perfect square missing only{" "}

      <Theorem title="the quadratic formula">
        <p>
          Let <M>{"a \\neq 0"}</M> and let <M>{"\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac"}</M>, the <strong>discriminant</strong>. The equation{" "}
          <M>{"ax^2 + bx + c = 0"}</M> has two real solutions if <M>{"\\Delta > 0"}</M>, one if <M>{"\\Delta = 0"}</M>, and
          none if <M>{"\\Delta < 0"}</M>. When <M>{"\\Delta \\ge 0"}</M> they are

        <MD>{"x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}."}</MD>
      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>Divide by <M>a</M>, then complete the square with <M>{"h = \\tfrac{b}{2a}"}</M>:</p>
        <MD>{"x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + \\frac{c}{a} = 0 \\iff \\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \\frac{c}{a} = 0 \\iff \\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}."}</MD>
        <p>
          The left side is a square, so it is never negative, and the denominator <M>{"4a^2"}</M> is positive. If{" "}
          <M>{"\\Delta < 0"}</M> the right side is negative and there is no solution. Otherwise, a number whose square is{" "}
          <M>{"\\tfrac{\\Delta}{4a^2}"}</M> is <M>{"\\pm\\tfrac{\\sqrt\\Delta}{2a}"}</M> (taking the sign of <M>a</M> into
          the <M>{"\\pm"}</M>), so <M>{"x = -\\tfrac{b}{2a} \\pm \\tfrac{\\sqrt\\Delta}{2a}"}</M>. These two values coincide
          exactly when <M>{"\\Delta = 0"}</M>.

      </Theorem>
      <Proof>
        <p>
          If <M>{"p(x) = (x - r)q(x)"}</M>, then <M>{"p(r) = 0 \\cdot q(r) = 0"}</M>. Conversely, for each <M>k</M> the

        <p>
          (check it by expanding: everything cancels except the two ends) shows that <M>{"x^k - r^k"}</M> has the factor{" "}
          <M>{"x - r"}</M>. Now <M>{"p(x) = p(x) - p(r) = \\sum a_k (x^k - r^k)"}</M>, a sum of terms each with that
          factor, so <M>{"x - r"}</M> divides <M>{"p(x)"}</M>.

      <Remark title="consequences">
        <p>
          The same argument shows that <M>{"p(r)"}</M> is the remainder when <M>{"p(x)"}</M> is divided by <M>{"x - r"}</M>.
          And a polynomial of degree <M>n</M> has at most <M>n</M> roots: each root splits off a factor <M>{"x - r"}</M> and
          lowers the degree by one. Whether every polynomial has a root at all, if we allow more numbers than the reals,
          is the fundamental theorem of algebra, which comes with complex numbers.

      This completes algebra. Next, functions: instead of solving for one value of <M>x</M>, you study how an expression
      changes as <M>x</M> varies, and quadratics become parabolas. When <M>{"\\Delta < 0"}</M>, the complex numbers
      supply the missing roots. Factorising returns as partial fractions in Calculus, and polynomials become objects of study in
      their own right, as polynomial rings, in Abstract Algebra.
